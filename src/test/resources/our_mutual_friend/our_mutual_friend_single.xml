<title>On The Look Out</title>
<p>
In these times of ours, though concerning the exact year there is no need 
to be precise, a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance, with two 
figures in it, floated on the Thames, between Southwark bridge which is of 
iron, and London Bridge which is of stone, as an autumn evening was 
closing in. 
</p>
<p>
The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled 
hair and a sun-browned face, and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty, 
sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter. The girl rowed, 
pulling a pair of sculls very easily; the man, with the rudder-lines slack 
in his hands, and his hands loose in his waistband, kept an eager look 
out. He had no net, hook, or line, and he could not be a fisherman; his 
boat had no cushion for a sitter, no paint, no inscription, no appliance 
beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope, and he could not be a 
waterman; his boat was too crazy and too small to take in cargo for 
delivery, and he could not be a lighterman or river-carrier; there was no 
clue to what he looked for, but he looked for something, with a most 
intent and searching gaze. The tide, which had turned an hour before, was 
running down, and his eyes watched every little race and eddy in its broad 
sweep, as the boat made slight head-way against it, or drove stern 
foremost before it, according as he directed his daughter by a movement of 
his head. She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river. But, 
in the intensity of her look there was a touch of dread or horror. 
</p>
<p>
Allied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface, by reason of 
the slime and ooze with which it was covered, and its sodden state, this 
boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they 
often did, and were seeking what they often sought. Half savage as the man 
showed, with no covering on his matted head, with his brown arms bare to 
between the elbow and the shoulder, with the loose knot of a looser 
kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard and 
whisker, with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the mud that 
begrimed his boat, still there was a business-like usage in his steady 
gaze. So with every lithe action of the girl, with every turn of her 
wrist, perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror; they were 
things of usage. 
</p>
<p>
'Keep her out, Lizzie. Tide runs strong here. Keep her well afore the 
sweep of it.' 
</p>
<p>
Trusting to the girl's skill and making no use of the rudder, he eyed the 
coming tide with an absorbed attention. So the girl eyed him. But, it 
happened now, that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced into the 
bottom of the boat, and, touching a rotten stain there which bore some 
resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form, coloured it as though 
with diluted blood. This caught the girl's eye, and she shivered. 
</p>
<p>
'What ails you?' said the man, immediately aware of it, though so intent 
on the advancing waters; 'I see nothing afloat.' 
</p>
<p>
The red light was gone, the shudder was gone, and his gaze, which had come 
back to the boat for a moment, travelled away again. Wheresoever the 
strong tide met with an impediment, his gaze paused for an instant. At 
every mooring-chain and rope, at every stationery boat or barge that split 
the current into a broad-arrowhead, at the offsets from the piers of 
Southwark Bridge, at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat the 
filthy water, at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying off 
certain wharves, his shining eyes darted a hungry look. After a darkening 
hour or so, suddenly the rudder-lines tightened in his hold, and he 
steered hard towards the Surrey shore. 
</p>
<p>
Always watching his face, the girl instantly answered to the action in her 
sculling; presently the boat swung round, quivered as from a sudden jerk, 
and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the stern. 
</p>
<p>
The girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore, over her head and over her 
face, and, looking backward so that the front folds of this hood were 
turned down the river, kept the boat in that direction going before the 
tide. Until now, the boat had barely held her own, and had hovered about 
one spot; but now, the banks changed swiftly, and the deepening shadows 
and the kindling lights of London Bridge were passed, and the tiers of 
shipping lay on either hand. 
</p>
<p>
It was not until now that the upper half of the man came back into the 
boat. His arms were wet and dirty, and he washed them over the side. In 
his right hand he held something, and he washed that in the river too. It 
was money. He chinked it once, and he blew upon it once, and he spat upon 
it once,--'for luck,' he hoarsely said--before he put it in his 
pocket. 
</p>
<p>
'Lizzie!' 
</p>
<p>
The girl turned her face towards him with a start, and rowed in silence. 
Her face was very pale. He was a hook-nosed man, and with that and his 
bright eyes and his ruffled head, bore a certain likeness to a roused bird 
of prey. 
</p>
<p>
'Take that thing off your face.' 
</p>
<p>
She put it back. 
</p>
<p>
'Here! and give me hold of the sculls. I'll take the rest of the spell.' 
</p>
<p>
'No, no, father! No! I can't indeed. Father!--I cannot sit so near 
it!' 
</p>
<p>
He was moving towards her to change places, but her terrified 
expostulation stopped him and he resumed his seat. 
</p>
<p>
'What hurt can it do you?' 
</p>
<p>
'None, none. But I cannot bear it.' 
</p>
<p>
'It's my belief you hate the sight of the very river.' 
</p>
<p>
'I--I do not like it, father.' 
</p>
<p>
'As if it wasn't your living! As if it wasn't meat and drink to you!' 
</p>
<p>
At these latter words the girl shivered again, and for a moment paused in 
her rowing, seeming to turn deadly faint. It escaped his attention, for he 
was glancing over the stern at something the boat had in tow. 
</p>
<p>
'How can you be so thankless to your best friend, Lizzie? The very fire 
that warmed you when you were a babby, was picked out of the river 
alongside the coal barges. The very basket that you slept in, the tide 
washed ashore. The very rockers that I put it upon to make a cradle of it, 
I cut out of a piece of wood that drifted from some ship or another.' 
</p>
<p>
Lizzie took her right hand from the scull it held, and touched her lips 
with it, and for a moment held it out lovingly towards him: then, without 
speaking, she resumed her rowing, as another boat of similar appearance, 
though in rather better trim, came out from a dark place and dropped 
softly alongside. 
</p>
<p>
'In luck again, Gaffer?' said a man with a squinting leer, who sculled her 
and who was alone, 'I know'd you was in luck again, by your wake as you 
come down.' 
</p>
<p>
'Ah!' replied the other, drily. 'So you're out, are you?' 
</p>
<p>
'Yes, pardner.' 
</p>
<p>
There was now a tender yellow moonlight on the river, and the new comer, 
keeping half his boat's length astern of the other boat looked hard at its 
track. 
</p>
<p>
'I says to myself,' he went on, 'directly you hove in view, yonder's 
Gaffer, and in luck again, by George if he ain't! Scull it is, pardner--don't 
fret yourself--I didn't touch him.' This was in answer to a quick 
impatient movement on the part of Gaffer: the speaker at the same time 
unshipping his scull on that side, and laying his hand on the gunwale of 
Gaffer's boat and holding to it. 
</p>
<p>
'He's had touches enough not to want no more, as well as I make him out, 
Gaffer! Been a knocking about with a pretty many tides, ain't he pardner? 
Such is my out-of-luck ways, you see! He must have passed me when he went 
up last time, for I was on the lookout below bridge here. I a'most think 
you're like the wulturs, pardner, and scent 'em out.' 
</p>
<p>
He spoke in a dropped voice, and with more than one glance at Lizzie who 
had pulled on her hood again. Both men then looked with a weird unholy 
interest in the wake of Gaffer's boat. 
</p>
<p>
'Easy does it, betwixt us. Shall I take him aboard, pardner?' 
</p>
<p>
'No,' said the other. In so surly a tone that the man, after a blank 
stare, acknowledged it with the retort: 
</p>
<p>
'--Arn't been eating nothing as has disagreed with you, have you, 
pardner?' 
</p>
<p>
'Why, yes, I have,' said Gaffer. 'I have been swallowing too much of that 
word, Pardner. I am no pardner of yours.' 
</p>
<p>
'Since when was you no pardner of mine, Gaffer Hexam Esquire?' 
</p>
<p>
'Since you was accused of robbing a man. Accused of robbing a live man!' 
said Gaffer, with great indignation. 
</p>
<p>
'And what if I had been accused of robbing a dead man, Gaffer?' 
</p>
<p>
'You <i>couldn't</i> do it.' 
</p>
<p>
'Couldn't you, Gaffer?' 
</p>
<p>
'No. Has a dead man any use for money? Is it possible for a dead man to 
have money? What world does a dead man belong to? 'Tother world. What 
world does money belong to? This world. How can money be a corpse's? Can a 
corpse own it, want it, spend it, claim it, miss it? Don't try to go 
confounding the rights and wrongs of things in that way. But it's worthy 
of the sneaking spirit that robs a live man.' 
</p>
<p>
'I'll tell you what it is--.' 
</p>
<p>
'No you won't. I'll tell you what it is. You got off with a short time of 
it for putting your hand in the pocket of a sailor, a live sailor. Make 
the most of it and think yourself lucky, but don't think after that to 
come over <i>me</i> with your pardners. We have worked together in time past, but 
we work together no more in time present nor yet future. Let go. Cast 
off!' 
</p>
<p>
'Gaffer! If you think to get rid of me this way--.' 
</p>
<p>
'If I don't get rid of you this way, I'll try another, and chop you over 
the fingers with the stretcher, or take a pick at your head with the 
boat-hook. Cast off! Pull you, Lizzie. Pull home, since you won't let your 
father pull.' 
</p>
<p>
Lizzie shot ahead, and the other boat fell astern. Lizzie's father, 
composing himself into the easy attitude of one who had asserted the high 
moralities and taken an unassailable position, slowly lighted a pipe, and 
smoked, and took a survey of what he had in tow. What he had in tow, 
lunged itself at him sometimes in an awful manner when the boat was 
checked, and sometimes seemed to try to wrench itself away, though for the 
most part it followed submissively. A neophyte might have fancied that the 
ripples passing over it were dreadfully like faint changes of expression 
on a sightless face; but Gaffer was no neophyte and had no fancies. 
</p>

<chapter title="The Man From Somewhere">
<p>
Mr and Mrs Veneering were bran-new people in a bran-new house in a 
bran-new quarter of London. Everything about the Veneerings was spick and 
span new. All their furniture was new, all their friends were new, all 
their servants were new, their plate was new, their carriage was new, 
their harness was new, their horses were new, their pictures were new, 
they themselves were new, they were as newly married as was lawfully 
compatible with their having a bran-new baby, and if they had set up a 
great-grandfather, he would have come home in matting from the 
Pantechnicon, without a scratch upon him, French polished to the crown of 
his head. 
</p>
<p>
For, in the Veneering establishment, from the hall-chairs with the new 
coat of arms, to the grand pianoforte with the new action, and upstairs 
again to the new fire-escape, all things were in a state of high varnish 
and polish. And what was observable in the furniture, was observable in 
the Veneerings--the surface smelt a little too much of the workshop 
and was a trifle sticky. 
</p>
<p>
There was an innocent piece of dinner-furniture that went upon easy 
castors and was kept over a livery stable-yard in Duke Street, Saint 
James's, when not in use, to whom the Veneerings were a source of blind 
confusion. The name of this article was Twemlow. Being first cousin to 
Lord Snigsworth, he was in frequent requisition, and at many houses might 
be said to represent the dining-table in its normal state. Mr and Mrs 
Veneering, for example, arranging a dinner, habitually started with 
Twemlow, and then put leaves in him, or added guests to him. Sometimes, 
the table consisted of Twemlow and half a dozen leaves; sometimes, of 
Twemlow and a dozen leaves; sometimes, Twemlow was pulled out to his 
utmost extent of twenty leaves. Mr and Mrs Veneering on occasions of 
ceremony faced each other in the centre of the board, and thus the 
parallel still held; for, it always happened that the more Twemlow was 
pulled out, the further he found himself from the center, and nearer to 
the sideboard at one end of the room, or the window-curtains at the other. 
</p>
<p>
But, it was not this which steeped the feeble soul of Twemlow in 
confusion. This he was used to, and could take soundings of. The abyss to 
which he could find no bottom, and from which started forth the engrossing 
and ever-swelling difficulty of his life, was the insoluble question 
whether he was Veneering's oldest friend, or newest friend. To the 
excogitation of this problem, the harmless gentleman had devoted many 
anxious hours, both in his lodgings over the livery stable-yard, and in 
the cold gloom, favourable to meditation, of Saint James's Square. Thus. 
Twemlow had first known Veneering at his club, where Veneering then knew 
nobody but the man who made them known to one another, who seemed to be 
the most intimate friend he had in the world, and whom he had known two 
days--the bond of union between their souls, the nefarious conduct of 
the committee respecting the cookery of a fillet of veal, having been 
accidentally cemented at that date. Immediately upon this, Twemlow 
received an invitation to dine with Veneering, and dined: the man being of 
the party. Immediately upon that, Twemlow received an invitation to dine 
with the man, and dined: Veneering being of the party. At the man's were a 
Member, an Engineer, a Payer-off of the National Debt, a Poem on 
Shakespeare, a Grievance, and a Public Office, who all seem to be utter 
strangers to Veneering. And yet immediately after that, Twemlow received 
an invitation to dine at Veneerings, expressly to meet the Member, the 
Engineer, the Payer-off of the National Debt, the Poem on Shakespeare, the 
Grievance, and the Public Office, and, dining, discovered that all of them 
were the most intimate friends Veneering had in the world, and that the 
wives of all of them (who were all there) were the objects of Mrs 
Veneering's most devoted affection and tender confidence. 
</p>
<p>
Thus it had come about, that Mr Twemlow had said to himself in his 
lodgings, with his hand to his forehead: 'I must not think of this. This 
is enough to soften any man's brain,'--and yet was always thinking of 
it, and could never form a conclusion. 
</p>
<p>
This evening the Veneerings give a banquet. Eleven leaves in the Twemlow; 
fourteen in company all told. Four pigeon-breasted retainers in plain 
clothes stand in line in the hall. A fifth retainer, proceeding up the 
staircase with a mournful air--as who should say, 'Here is another 
wretched creature come to dinner; such is life!'--announces, 'Mis-ter 
Twemlow!' 
</p>
<p>
Mrs Veneering welcomes her sweet Mr Twemlow. Mr Veneering welcomes his 
dear Twemlow. Mrs Veneering does not expect that Mr Twemlow can in nature 
care much for such insipid things as babies, but so old a friend must 
please to look at baby. 'Ah! You will know the friend of your family 
better, Tootleums,' says Mr Veneering, nodding emotionally at that new 
article, 'when you begin to take notice.' He then begs to make his dear 
Twemlow known to his two friends, Mr Boots and Mr Brewer--and clearly 
has no distinct idea which is which. 
</p>
<p>
But now a fearful circumstance occurs. 
</p>
<p>
'Mis-ter and Mis-sus Podsnap!' 
</p>
<p>
'My dear,' says Mr Veneering to Mrs Veneering, with an air of much 
friendly interest, while the door stands open, 'the Podsnaps.' 
</p>
<p>
A too, too smiling large man, with a fatal freshness on him, appearing 
with his wife, instantly deserts his wife and darts at Twemlow with: 
</p>
<p>
'How do you do? So glad to know you. Charming house you have here. I hope 
we are not late. So glad of the opportunity, I am sure!' 
</p>
<p>
When the first shock fell upon him, Twemlow twice skipped back in his neat 
little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone fashion, as if 
impelled to leap over a sofa behind him; but the large man closed with him 
and proved too strong. 
</p>
<p>
'Let me,' says the large man, trying to attract the attention of his wife 
in the distance, 'have the pleasure of presenting Mrs Podsnap to her host. 
She will be,' in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual verdure 
and eternal youth in the phrase, 'she will be so glad of the opportunity, 
I am sure!' 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Mrs Podsnap, unable to originate a mistake on her own 
account, because Mrs Veneering is the only other lady there, does her best 
in the way of handsomely supporting her husband's, by looking towards Mr 
Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and remarking to Mrs Veneering in a 
feeling manner, firstly, that she fears he has been rather bilious of 
late, and, secondly, that the baby is already very like him. 
</p>
<p>
It is questionable whether any man quite relishes being mistaken for any 
other man; but, Mr Veneering having this very evening set up the 
shirt-front of the young Antinous in new worked cambric just come home, is 
not at all complimented by being supposed to be Twemlow, who is dry and 
weazen and some thirty years older. Mrs Veneering equally resents the 
imputation of being the wife of Twemlow. As to Twemlow, he is so sensible 
of being a much better bred man than Veneering, that he considers the 
large man an offensive ass. 
</p>
<p>
In this complicated dilemma, Mr Veneering approaches the large man with 
extended hand and, smilingly assures that incorrigible personage that he 
is delighted to see him: who in his fatal freshness instantly replies: 
</p>
<p>
'Thank you. I am ashamed to say that I cannot at this moment recall where 
we met, but I am so glad of this opportunity, I am sure!' 
</p>
<p>
Then pouncing upon Twemlow, who holds back with all his feeble might, he 
is haling him off to present him, as Veneering, to Mrs Podsnap, when the 
arrival of more guests unravels the mistake. Whereupon, having re-shaken 
hands with Veneering as Veneering, he re-shakes hands with Twemlow as 
Twemlow, and winds it all up to his own perfect satisfaction by saying to 
the last-named, 'Ridiculous opportunity--but so glad of it, I am 
sure!' 
</p>
<p>
Now, Twemlow having undergone this terrific experience, having likewise 
noted the fusion of Boots in Brewer and Brewer in Boots, and having 
further observed that of the remaining seven guests four discrete 
characters enter with wandering eyes and wholly declined to commit 
themselves as to which is Veneering, until Veneering has them in his 
grasp;--Twemlow having profited by these studies, finds his brain 
wholesomely hardening as he approaches the conclusion that he really is 
Veneering's oldest friend, when his brain softens again and all is lost, 
through his eyes encountering Veneering and the large man linked together 
as twin brothers in the back drawing-room near the conservatory door, and 
through his ears informing him in the tones of Mrs Veneering that the same 
large man is to be baby's godfather. 
</p>
<p>
'Dinner is on the table!' 
</p>
<p>
Thus the melancholy retainer, as who should say, 'Come down and be 
poisoned, ye unhappy children of men!' 
</p>
<p>
Twemlow, having no lady assigned him, goes down in the rear, with his hand 
to his forehead. Boots and Brewer, thinking him indisposed, whisper, 'Man 
faint. Had no lunch.' But he is only stunned by the unvanquishable 
difficulty of his existence. 
</p>
<p>
Revived by soup, Twemlow discourses mildly of the Court Circular with 
Boots and Brewer. Is appealed to, at the fish stage of the banquet, by 
Veneering, on the disputed question whether his cousin Lord Snigsworth is 
in or out of town? Gives it that his cousin is out of town. 'At 
Snigsworthy Park?' Veneering inquires. 'At Snigsworthy,' Twemlow rejoins. 
Boots and Brewer regard this as a man to be cultivated; and Veneering is 
clear that he is a remunerative article. Meantime the retainer goes round, 
like a gloomy Analytical Chemist: always seeming to say, after 'Chablis, 
sir?'--'You wouldn't if you knew what it's made of.' 
</p>
<p>
The great looking-glass above the sideboard, reflects the table and the 
company. Reflects the new Veneering crest, in gold and eke in silver, 
frosted and also thawed, a camel of all work. The Heralds' College found 
out a Crusading ancestor for Veneering who bore a camel on his shield (or 
might have done it if he had thought of it), and a caravan of camels take 
charge of the fruits and flowers and candles, and kneel down to be loaded 
with the salt. Reflects Veneering; forty, wavy-haired, dark, tending to 
corpulence, sly, mysterious, filmy--a kind of sufficiently 
well-looking veiled-prophet, not prophesying. Reflects Mrs Veneering; 
fair, aquiline-nosed and fingered, not so much light hair as she might 
have, gorgeous in raiment and jewels, enthusiastic, propitiatory, 
conscious that a corner of her husband's veil is over herself. Reflects 
Podsnap; prosperously feeding, two little light-coloured wiry wings, one 
on either side of his else bald head, looking as like his hairbrushes as 
his hair, dissolving view of red beads on his forehead, large allowance of 
crumpled shirt-collar up behind. Reflects Mrs Podsnap; fine woman for 
Professor Owen, quantity of bone, neck and nostrils like a rocking-horse, 
hard features, majestic head-dress in which Podsnap has hung golden 
offerings. Reflects Twemlow; grey, dry, polite, susceptible to east wind, 
First-Gentleman-in-Europe collar and cravat, cheeks drawn in as if he had 
made a great effort to retire into himself some years ago, and had got so 
far and had never got any farther. Reflects mature young lady; raven 
locks, and complexion that lights up well when well powdered--as it 
is--carrying on considerably in the captivation of mature young 
gentleman; with too much nose in his face, too much ginger in his 
whiskers, too much torso in his waistcoat, too much sparkle in his studs, 
his eyes, his buttons, his talk, and his teeth. Reflects charming old Lady 
Tippins on Veneering's right; with an immense obtuse drab oblong face, 
like a face in a tablespoon, and a dyed Long Walk up the top of her head, 
as a convenient public approach to the bunch of false hair behind, pleased 
to patronize Mrs Veneering opposite, who is pleased to be patronized. 
Reflects a certain 'Mortimer', another of Veneering's oldest friends; who 
never was in the house before, and appears not to want to come again, who 
sits disconsolate on Mrs Veneering's left, and who was inveigled by Lady 
Tippins (a friend of his boyhood) to come to these people's and talk, and 
who won't talk. Reflects Eugene, friend of Mortimer; buried alive in the 
back of his chair, behind a shoulder--with a powder-epaulette on it--of 
the mature young lady, and gloomily resorting to the champagne chalice 
whenever proffered by the Analytical Chemist. Lastly, the looking-glass 
reflects Boots and Brewer, and two other stuffed Buffers interposed 
between the rest of the company and possible accidents. 
</p>
<p>
The Veneering dinners are excellent dinners--or new people wouldn't 
come--and all goes well. Notably, Lady Tippins has made a series of 
experiments on her digestive functions, so extremely complicated and 
daring, that if they could be published with their results it might 
benefit the human race. Having taken in provisions from all parts of the 
world, this hardy old cruiser has last touched at the North Pole, when, as 
the ice-plates are being removed, the following words fall from her: 
</p>
<p>
'I assure you, my dear Veneering--' 
</p>
<p>
(Poor Twemlow's hand approaches his forehead, for it would seem now, that 
Lady Tippins is going to be the oldest friend.) 
</p>
<p>
'I assure you, my dear Veneering, that it is the oddest affair! Like the 
advertising people, I don't ask you to trust me, without offering a 
respectable reference. Mortimer there, is my reference, and knows all 
about it.' 
</p>
<p>
Mortimer raises his drooping eyelids, and slightly opens his mouth. But a 
faint smile, expressive of 'What's the use!' passes over his face, and he 
drops his eyelids and shuts his mouth. 
</p>
<p>
'Now, Mortimer,' says Lady Tippins, rapping the sticks of her closed green 
fan upon the knuckles of her left hand--which is particularly rich in 
knuckles, 'I insist upon your telling all that is to be told about the man 
from Jamaica.' 
</p>
<p>
'Give you my honour I never heard of any man from Jamaica, except the man 
who was a brother,' replies Mortimer. 
</p>
<p>
'Tobago, then.' 
</p>
<p>
'Nor yet from Tobago.' 
</p>
<p>
'Except,' Eugene strikes in: so unexpectedly that the mature young lady, 
who has forgotten all about him, with a start takes the epaulette out of 
his way: 'except our friend who long lived on rice-pudding and isinglass, 
till at length to his something or other, his physician said something 
else, and a leg of mutton somehow ended in daygo.' 
</p>
<p>
A reviving impression goes round the table that Eugene is coming out. An 
unfulfilled impression, for he goes in again. 
</p>
<p>
'Now, my dear Mrs Veneering,' quoth Lady Tippins, I appeal to you whether 
this is not the basest conduct ever known in this world? I carry my lovers 
about, two or three at a time, on condition that they are very obedient 
and devoted; and here is my oldest lover-in-chief, the head of all my 
slaves, throwing off his allegiance before company! And here is another of 
my lovers, a rough Cymon at present certainly, but of whom I had most 
hopeful expectations as to his turning out well in course of time, 
pretending that he can't remember his nursery rhymes! On purpose to annoy 
me, for he knows how I doat upon them!' 
</p>
<p>
A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is Lady Tippins's point. She 
is always attended by a lover or two, and she keeps a little list of her 
lovers, and she is always booking a new lover, or striking out an old 
lover, or putting a lover in her black list, or promoting a lover to her 
blue list, or adding up her lovers, or otherwise posting her book. Mrs 
Veneering is charmed by the humour, and so is Veneering. Perhaps it is 
enhanced by a certain yellow play in Lady Tippins's throat, like the legs 
of scratching poultry. 
</p>
<p>
'I banish the false wretch from this moment, and I strike him out of my 
Cupidon (my name for my Ledger, my dear,) this very night. But I am 
resolved to have the account of the man from Somewhere, and I beg you to 
elicit it for me, my love,' to Mrs Veneering, 'as I have lost my own 
influence. Oh, you perjured man!' This to Mortimer, with a rattle of her 
fan. 
</p>
<p>
'We are all very much interested in the man from Somewhere,' Veneering 
observes. 
</p>
<p>
Then the four Buffers, taking heart of grace all four at once, say: 
</p>
<p>
'Deeply interested!' 
</p>
<p>
'Quite excited!' 
</p>
<p>
'Dramatic!' 
</p>
<p>
'Man from Nowhere, perhaps!' 
</p>
<p>
And then Mrs Veneering--for the Lady Tippins's winning wiles are 
contagious--folds her hands in the manner of a supplicating child, 
turns to her left neighbour, and says, 'Tease! Pay! Man from Tumwhere!' At 
which the four Buffers, again mysteriously moved all four at once, 
explain, 'You can't resist!' 
</p>
<p>
'Upon my life,' says Mortimer languidly, 'I find it immensely embarrassing 
to have the eyes of Europe upon me to this extent, and my only consolation 
is that you will all of you execrate Lady Tippins in your secret hearts 
when you find, as you inevitably will, the man from Somewhere a bore. 
Sorry to destroy romance by fixing him with a local habitation, but he 
comes from the place, the name of which escapes me, but will suggest 
itself to everybody else here, where they make the wine.' 
</p>
<p>
Eugene suggests 'Day and Martin's.' 
</p>
<p>
'No, not that place,' returns the unmoved Mortimer, 'that's where they 
make the Port. My man comes from the country where they make the Cape 
Wine. But look here, old fellow; its not at all statistical and it's 
rather odd.' 
</p>
<p>
It is always noticeable at the table of the Veneerings, that no man 
troubles himself much about the Veneerings themselves, and that any one 
who has anything to tell, generally tells it to anybody else in 
preference. 
</p>
<p>
'The man,' Mortimer goes on, addressing Eugene, 'whose name is Harmon, was 
only son of a tremendous old rascal who made his money by Dust.' 
</p>
<p>
'Red velveteens and a bell?' the gloomy Eugene inquires. 
</p>
<p>
'And a ladder and basket if you like. By which means, or by others, he 
grew rich as a Dust Contractor, and lived in a hollow in a hilly country 
entirely composed of Dust. On his own small estate the growling old 
vagabond threw up his own mountain range, like an old volcano, and its 
geological formation was Dust. Coal-dust, vegetable-dust, bone-dust, 
crockery dust, rough dust and sifted dust,--all manner of Dust.' 
</p>
<p>
A passing remembrance of Mrs Veneering, here induces Mortimer to address 
his next half-dozen words to her; after which he wanders away again, tries 
Twemlow and finds he doesn't answer, ultimately takes up with the Buffers 
who receive him enthusiastically. 
</p>
<p>
'The moral being--I believe that's the right expression--of this 
exemplary person, derived its highest gratification from anathematizing 
his nearest relations and turning them out of doors. Having begun (as was 
natural) by rendering these attentions to the wife of his bosom, he next 
found himself at leisure to bestow a similar recognition on the claims of 
his daughter. He chose a husband for her, entirely to his own satisfaction 
and not in the least to hers, and proceeded to settle upon her, as her 
marriage portion, I don't know how much Dust, but something immense. At 
this stage of the affair the poor girl respectfully intimated that she was 
secretly engaged to that popular character whom the novelists and 
versifiers call Another, and that such a marriage would make Dust of her 
heart and Dust of her life--in short, would set her up, on a very 
extensive scale, in her father's business. Immediately, the venerable 
parent--on a cold winter's night, it is said--anathematized and 
turned her out.' 
</p>
<p>
Here, the Analytical Chemist (who has evidently formed a very low opinion 
of Mortimer's story) concedes a little claret to the Buffers; who, again 
mysteriously moved all four at once, screw it slowly into themselves with 
a peculiar twist of enjoyment, as they cry in chorus, 'Pray go on.' 
</p>
<p>
'The pecuniary resources of Another were, as they usually are, of a very 
limited nature. I believe I am not using too strong an expression when I 
say that Another was hard up. However, he married the young lady, and they 
lived in a humble dwelling, probably possessing a porch ornamented with 
honeysuckle and woodbine twining, until she died. I must refer you to the 
Registrar of the District in which the humble dwelling was situated, for 
the certified cause of death; but early sorrow and anxiety may have had to 
do with it, though they may not appear in the ruled pages and printed 
forms. Indisputably this was the case with Another, for he was so cut up 
by the loss of his young wife that if he outlived her a year it was as 
much as he did.' 
</p>
<p>
There is that in the indolent Mortimer, which seems to hint that if good 
society might on any account allow itself to be impressible, he, one of 
good society, might have the weakness to be impressed by what he here 
relates. It is hidden with great pains, but it is in him. The gloomy 
Eugene too, is not without some kindred touch; for, when that appalling 
Lady Tippins declares that if Another had survived, he should have gone 
down at the head of her list of lovers--and also when the mature 
young lady shrugs her epaulettes, and laughs at some private and 
confidential comment from the mature young gentleman--his gloom 
deepens to that degree that he trifles quite ferociously with his 
dessert-knife. 
</p>
<p>
Mortimer proceeds. 
</p>
<p>
'We must now return, as novelists say, and as we all wish they wouldn't, 
to the man from Somewhere. Being a boy of fourteen, cheaply educated at 
Brussels when his sister's expulsion befell, it was some little time 
before he heard of it--probably from herself, for the mother was 
dead; but that I don't know. Instantly, he absconded, and came over here. 
He must have been a boy of spirit and resource, to get here on a stopped 
allowance of five sous a week; but he did it somehow, and he burst in on 
his father, and pleaded his sister's cause. Venerable parent promptly 
resorts to anathematization, and turns him out. Shocked and terrified boy 
takes flight, seeks his fortune, gets aboard ship, ultimately turns up on 
dry land among the Cape wine: small proprietor, farmer, grower--whatever 
you like to call it.' 
</p>
<p>
At this juncture, shuffling is heard in the hall, and tapping is heard at 
the dining-room door. Analytical Chemist goes to the door, confers angrily 
with unseen tapper, appears to become mollified by descrying reason in the 
tapping, and goes out. 
</p>
<p>
'So he was discovered, only the other day, after having been expatriated 
about fourteen years.' 
</p>
<p>
A Buffer, suddenly astounding the other three, by detaching himself, and 
asserting individuality, inquires: 'How discovered, and why?' 
</p>
<p>
'Ah! To be sure. Thank you for reminding me. Venerable parent dies.' 
</p>
<p>
Same Buffer, emboldened by success, says: 'When?' 
</p>
<p>
'The other day. Ten or twelve months ago.' 
</p>
<p>
Same Buffer inquires with smartness, 'What of?' But herein perishes a 
melancholy example; being regarded by the three other Buffers with a stony 
stare, and attracting no further attention from any mortal. 
</p>
<p>
'Venerable parent,' Mortimer repeats with a passing remembrance that there 
is a Veneering at table, and for the first time addressing him--'dies.' 
</p>
<p>
The gratified Veneering repeats, gravely, 'dies'; and folds his arms, and 
composes his brow to hear it out in a judicial manner, when he finds 
himself again deserted in the bleak world. 
</p>
<p>
'His will is found,' said Mortimer, catching Mrs Podsnap's rocking-horse's 
eye. 'It is dated very soon after the son's flight. It leaves the lowest 
of the range of dust-mountains, with some sort of a dwelling-house at its 
foot, to an old servant who is sole executor, and all the rest of the 
property--which is very considerable--to the son. He directs 
himself to be buried with certain eccentric ceremonies and precautions 
against his coming to life, with which I need not bore you, and that's all--except--' 
and this ends the story. 
</p>
<p>
The Analytical Chemist returning, everybody looks at him. Not because 
anybody wants to see him, but because of that subtle influence in nature 
which impels humanity to embrace the slightest opportunity of looking at 
anything, rather than the person who addresses it. 
</p>
<p>
'--Except that the son's inheriting is made conditional on his 
marrying a girl, who at the date of the will, was a child of four or five 
years old, and who is now a marriageable young woman. Advertisement and 
inquiry discovered the son in the man from Somewhere, and at the present 
moment, he is on his way home from there--no doubt, in a state of 
great astonishment--to succeed to a very large fortune, and to take a 
wife.' 
</p>
<p>
Mrs Podsnap inquires whether the young person is a young person of 
personal charms? Mortimer is unable to report. 
</p>
<p>
Mr Podsnap inquires what would become of the very large fortune, in the 
event of the marriage condition not being fulfilled? Mortimer replies, 
that by special testamentary clause it would then go to the old servant 
above mentioned, passing over and excluding the son; also, that if the son 
had not been living, the same old servant would have been sole residuary 
legatee. 
</p>
<p>
Mrs Veneering has just succeeded in waking Lady Tippins from a snore, by 
dexterously shunting a train of plates and dishes at her knuckles across 
the table; when everybody but Mortimer himself becomes aware that the 
Analytical Chemist is, in a ghostly manner, offering him a folded paper. 
Curiosity detains Mrs Veneering a few moments. 
</p>
<p>
Mortimer, in spite of all the arts of the chemist, placidly refreshes 
himself with a glass of Madeira, and remains unconscious of the Document 
which engrosses the general attention, until Lady Tippins (who has a habit 
of waking totally insensible), having remembered where she is, and 
recovered a perception of surrounding objects, says: 'Falser man than Don 
Juan; why don't you take the note from the commendatore?' Upon which, the 
chemist advances it under the nose of Mortimer, who looks round at him, 
and says: 
</p>
<p>
'What's this?' 
</p>
<p>
Analytical Chemist bends and whispers. 
</p>
<p>
'<i>Who</i>?' Says Mortimer. 
</p>
<p>
Analytical Chemist again bends and whispers. 
</p>
<p>
Mortimer stares at him, and unfolds the paper. Reads it, reads it twice, 
turns it over to look at the blank outside, reads it a third time. 
</p>
<p>
'This arrives in an extraordinarily opportune manner,' says Mortimer then, 
looking with an altered face round the table: 'this is the conclusion of 
the story of the identical man.' 
</p>
<p>
'Already married?' one guesses. 
</p>
<p>
'Declines to marry?' another guesses. 
</p>
<p>
'Codicil among the dust?' another guesses. 
</p>
<p>
'Why, no,' says Mortimer; 'remarkable thing, you are all wrong. The story 
is completer and rather more exciting than I supposed. Man's drowned!'
