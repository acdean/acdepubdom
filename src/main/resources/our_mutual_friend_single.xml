<chapter title="On The Look Out">
<p>
In these times of ours, though concerning the exact year there is no need 
to be precise, a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance, with two 
figures in it, floated on the Thames, between Southwark bridge which is of 
iron, and London Bridge which is of stone, as an autumn evening was 
closing in. 
</p>
<p>
The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled 
hair and a sun-browned face, and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty, 
sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter. The girl rowed, 
pulling a pair of sculls very easily; the man, with the rudder-lines slack 
in his hands, and his hands loose in his waistband, kept an eager look 
out. He had no net, hook, or line, and he could not be a fisherman; his 
boat had no cushion for a sitter, no paint, no inscription, no appliance 
beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope, and he could not be a 
waterman; his boat was too crazy and too small to take in cargo for 
delivery, and he could not be a lighterman or river-carrier; there was no 
clue to what he looked for, but he looked for something, with a most 
intent and searching gaze. The tide, which had turned an hour before, was 
running down, and his eyes watched every little race and eddy in its broad 
sweep, as the boat made slight head-way against it, or drove stern 
foremost before it, according as he directed his daughter by a movement of 
his head. She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river. But, 
in the intensity of her look there was a touch of dread or horror. 
</p>
<p>
Allied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface, by reason of 
the slime and ooze with which it was covered, and its sodden state, this 
boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they 
often did, and were seeking what they often sought. Half savage as the man 
showed, with no covering on his matted head, with his brown arms bare to 
between the elbow and the shoulder, with the loose knot of a looser 
kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard and 
whisker, with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the mud that 
begrimed his boat, still there was a business-like usage in his steady 
gaze. So with every lithe action of the girl, with every turn of her 
wrist, perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror; they were 
things of usage. 
</p>
<p>
'Keep her out, Lizzie. Tide runs strong here. Keep her well afore the 
sweep of it.' 
</p>
<p>
Trusting to the girl's skill and making no use of the rudder, he eyed the 
coming tide with an absorbed attention. So the girl eyed him. But, it 
happened now, that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced into the 
bottom of the boat, and, touching a rotten stain there which bore some 
resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form, coloured it as though 
with diluted blood. This caught the girl's eye, and she shivered. 
</p>
<p>
'What ails you?' said the man, immediately aware of it, though so intent 
on the advancing waters; 'I see nothing afloat.' 
</p>
<p>
The red light was gone, the shudder was gone, and his gaze, which had come 
back to the boat for a moment, travelled away again. Wheresoever the 
strong tide met with an impediment, his gaze paused for an instant. At 
every mooring-chain and rope, at every stationery boat or barge that split 
the current into a broad-arrowhead, at the offsets from the piers of 
Southwark Bridge, at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat the 
filthy water, at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying off 
certain wharves, his shining eyes darted a hungry look. After a darkening 
hour or so, suddenly the rudder-lines tightened in his hold, and he 
steered hard towards the Surrey shore. 
</p>
<p>
Always watching his face, the girl instantly answered to the action in her 
sculling; presently the boat swung round, quivered as from a sudden jerk, 
and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the stern. 
</p>
<p>
The girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore, over her head and over her 
face, and, looking backward so that the front folds of this hood were 
turned down the river, kept the boat in that direction going before the 
tide. Until now, the boat had barely held her own, and had hovered about 
one spot; but now, the banks changed swiftly, and the deepening shadows 
and the kindling lights of London Bridge were passed, and the tiers of 
shipping lay on either hand. 
</p>
<p>
It was not until now that the upper half of the man came back into the 
boat. His arms were wet and dirty, and he washed them over the side. In 
his right hand he held something, and he washed that in the river too. It 
was money. He chinked it once, and he blew upon it once, and he spat upon 
it once,--'for luck,' he hoarsely said--before he put it in his 
pocket. 
</p>
<p>
'Lizzie!' 
</p>
<p>
The girl turned her face towards him with a start, and rowed in silence. 
Her face was very pale. He was a hook-nosed man, and with that and his 
bright eyes and his ruffled head, bore a certain likeness to a roused bird 
of prey. 
</p>
<p>
'Take that thing off your face.' 
</p>
<p>
She put it back. 
</p>
<p>
'Here! and give me hold of the sculls. I'll take the rest of the spell.' 
</p>
<p>
'No, no, father! No! I can't indeed. Father!--I cannot sit so near 
it!' 
</p>
<p>
He was moving towards her to change places, but her terrified 
expostulation stopped him and he resumed his seat. 
</p>
<p>
'What hurt can it do you?' 
</p>
<p>
'None, none. But I cannot bear it.' 
</p>
<p>
'It's my belief you hate the sight of the very river.' 
</p>
<p>
'I--I do not like it, father.' 
</p>
<p>
'As if it wasn't your living! As if it wasn't meat and drink to you!' 
</p>
<p>
At these latter words the girl shivered again, and for a moment paused in 
her rowing, seeming to turn deadly faint. It escaped his attention, for he 
was glancing over the stern at something the boat had in tow. 
</p>
<p>
'How can you be so thankless to your best friend, Lizzie? The very fire 
that warmed you when you were a babby, was picked out of the river 
alongside the coal barges. The very basket that you slept in, the tide 
washed ashore. The very rockers that I put it upon to make a cradle of it, 
I cut out of a piece of wood that drifted from some ship or another.' 
</p>
<p>
Lizzie took her right hand from the scull it held, and touched her lips 
with it, and for a moment held it out lovingly towards him: then, without 
speaking, she resumed her rowing, as another boat of similar appearance, 
though in rather better trim, came out from a dark place and dropped 
softly alongside. 
</p>
<p>
'In luck again, Gaffer?' said a man with a squinting leer, who sculled her 
and who was alone, 'I know'd you was in luck again, by your wake as you 
come down.' 
</p>
<p>
'Ah!' replied the other, drily. 'So you're out, are you?' 
</p>
<p>
'Yes, pardner.' 
</p>
<p>
There was now a tender yellow moonlight on the river, and the new comer, 
keeping half his boat's length astern of the other boat looked hard at its 
track. 
</p>
<p>
'I says to myself,' he went on, 'directly you hove in view, yonder's 
Gaffer, and in luck again, by George if he ain't! Scull it is, pardner--don't 
fret yourself--I didn't touch him.' This was in answer to a quick 
impatient movement on the part of Gaffer: the speaker at the same time 
unshipping his scull on that side, and laying his hand on the gunwale of 
Gaffer's boat and holding to it. 
</p>
<p>
'He's had touches enough not to want no more, as well as I make him out, 
Gaffer! Been a knocking about with a pretty many tides, ain't he pardner? 
Such is my out-of-luck ways, you see! He must have passed me when he went 
up last time, for I was on the lookout below bridge here. I a'most think 
you're like the wulturs, pardner, and scent 'em out.' 
</p>
<p>
He spoke in a dropped voice, and with more than one glance at Lizzie who 
had pulled on her hood again. Both men then looked with a weird unholy 
interest in the wake of Gaffer's boat. 
</p>
<p>
'Easy does it, betwixt us. Shall I take him aboard, pardner?' 
</p>
<p>
'No,' said the other. In so surly a tone that the man, after a blank 
stare, acknowledged it with the retort: 
</p>
<p>
'--Arn't been eating nothing as has disagreed with you, have you, 
pardner?' 
</p>
<p>
'Why, yes, I have,' said Gaffer. 'I have been swallowing too much of that 
word, Pardner. I am no pardner of yours.' 
</p>
<p>
'Since when was you no pardner of mine, Gaffer Hexam Esquire?' 
</p>
<p>
'Since you was accused of robbing a man. Accused of robbing a live man!' 
said Gaffer, with great indignation. 
</p>
<p>
'And what if I had been accused of robbing a dead man, Gaffer?' 
</p>
<p>
'You <i>couldn't</i> do it.' 
</p>
<p>
'Couldn't you, Gaffer?' 
</p>
<p>
'No. Has a dead man any use for money? Is it possible for a dead man to 
have money? What world does a dead man belong to? 'Tother world. What 
world does money belong to? This world. How can money be a corpse's? Can a 
corpse own it, want it, spend it, claim it, miss it? Don't try to go 
confounding the rights and wrongs of things in that way. But it's worthy 
of the sneaking spirit that robs a live man.' 
</p>
<p>
'I'll tell you what it is--.' 
</p>
<p>
'No you won't. I'll tell you what it is. You got off with a short time of 
it for putting your hand in the pocket of a sailor, a live sailor. Make 
the most of it and think yourself lucky, but don't think after that to 
come over <i>me</i> with your pardners. We have worked together in time past, but 
we work together no more in time present nor yet future. Let go. Cast 
off!' 
</p>
<p>
'Gaffer! If you think to get rid of me this way--.' 
</p>
<p>
'If I don't get rid of you this way, I'll try another, and chop you over 
the fingers with the stretcher, or take a pick at your head with the 
boat-hook. Cast off! Pull you, Lizzie. Pull home, since you won't let your 
father pull.' 
</p>
<p>
Lizzie shot ahead, and the other boat fell astern. Lizzie's father, 
composing himself into the easy attitude of one who had asserted the high 
moralities and taken an unassailable position, slowly lighted a pipe, and 
smoked, and took a survey of what he had in tow. What he had in tow, 
lunged itself at him sometimes in an awful manner when the boat was 
checked, and sometimes seemed to try to wrench itself away, though for the 
most part it followed submissively. A neophyte might have fancied that the 
ripples passing over it were dreadfully like faint changes of expression 
on a sightless face; but Gaffer was no neophyte and had no fancies.

<chapter>
<title>The Man From Somewhere</title>
<p>
Mr and Mrs Veneering were bran-new people in a bran-new house in a 
bran-new quarter of London. Everything about the Veneerings was spick and 
span new. All their furniture was new, all their friends were new, all 
their servants were new, their plate was new, their carriage was new, 
their harness was new, their horses were new, their pictures were new, 
they themselves were new, they were as newly married as was lawfully 
compatible with their having a bran-new baby, and if they had set up a 
great-grandfather, he would have come home in matting from the 
Pantechnicon, without a scratch upon him, French polished to the crown of 
his head. 
</p>
<p>
For, in the Veneering establishment, from the hall-chairs with the new 
coat of arms, to the grand pianoforte with the new action, and upstairs 
again to the new fire-escape, all things were in a state of high varnish 
and polish. And what was observable in the furniture, was observable in 
the Veneerings--the surface smelt a little too much of the workshop 
and was a trifle sticky. 
</p>
<p>
There was an innocent piece of dinner-furniture that went upon easy 
castors and was kept over a livery stable-yard in Duke Street, Saint 
James's, when not in use, to whom the Veneerings were a source of blind 
confusion. The name of this article was Twemlow. Being first cousin to 
Lord Snigsworth, he was in frequent requisition, and at many houses might 
be said to represent the dining-table in its normal state. Mr and Mrs 
Veneering, for example, arranging a dinner, habitually started with 
Twemlow, and then put leaves in him, or added guests to him. Sometimes, 
the table consisted of Twemlow and half a dozen leaves; sometimes, of 
Twemlow and a dozen leaves; sometimes, Twemlow was pulled out to his 
utmost extent of twenty leaves. Mr and Mrs Veneering on occasions of 
ceremony faced each other in the centre of the board, and thus the 
parallel still held; for, it always happened that the more Twemlow was 
pulled out, the further he found himself from the center, and nearer to 
the sideboard at one end of the room, or the window-curtains at the other. 
</p>
<p>
But, it was not this which steeped the feeble soul of Twemlow in 
confusion. This he was used to, and could take soundings of. The abyss to 
which he could find no bottom, and from which started forth the engrossing 
and ever-swelling difficulty of his life, was the insoluble question 
whether he was Veneering's oldest friend, or newest friend. To the 
excogitation of this problem, the harmless gentleman had devoted many 
anxious hours, both in his lodgings over the livery stable-yard, and in 
the cold gloom, favourable to meditation, of Saint James's Square. Thus. 
Twemlow had first known Veneering at his club, where Veneering then knew 
nobody but the man who made them known to one another, who seemed to be 
the most intimate friend he had in the world, and whom he had known two 
days--the bond of union between their souls, the nefarious conduct of 
the committee respecting the cookery of a fillet of veal, having been 
accidentally cemented at that date. Immediately upon this, Twemlow 
received an invitation to dine with Veneering, and dined: the man being of 
the party. Immediately upon that, Twemlow received an invitation to dine 
with the man, and dined: Veneering being of the party. At the man's were a 
Member, an Engineer, a Payer-off of the National Debt, a Poem on 
Shakespeare, a Grievance, and a Public Office, who all seem to be utter 
strangers to Veneering. And yet immediately after that, Twemlow received 
an invitation to dine at Veneerings, expressly to meet the Member, the 
Engineer, the Payer-off of the National Debt, the Poem on Shakespeare, the 
Grievance, and the Public Office, and, dining, discovered that all of them 
were the most intimate friends Veneering had in the world, and that the 
wives of all of them (who were all there) were the objects of Mrs 
Veneering's most devoted affection and tender confidence. 
</p>
<p>
Thus it had come about, that Mr Twemlow had said to himself in his 
lodgings, with his hand to his forehead: 'I must not think of this. This 
is enough to soften any man's brain,'--and yet was always thinking of 
it, and could never form a conclusion. 
</p>
<p>
This evening the Veneerings give a banquet. Eleven leaves in the Twemlow; 
fourteen in company all told. Four pigeon-breasted retainers in plain 
clothes stand in line in the hall. A fifth retainer, proceeding up the 
staircase with a mournful air--as who should say, 'Here is another 
wretched creature come to dinner; such is life!'--announces, 'Mis-ter 
Twemlow!' 
</p>
<p>
Mrs Veneering welcomes her sweet Mr Twemlow. Mr Veneering welcomes his 
dear Twemlow. Mrs Veneering does not expect that Mr Twemlow can in nature 
care much for such insipid things as babies, but so old a friend must 
please to look at baby. 'Ah! You will know the friend of your family 
better, Tootleums,' says Mr Veneering, nodding emotionally at that new 
article, 'when you begin to take notice.' He then begs to make his dear 
Twemlow known to his two friends, Mr Boots and Mr Brewer--and clearly 
has no distinct idea which is which. 
</p>
<p>
But now a fearful circumstance occurs. 
</p>
<p>
'Mis-ter and Mis-sus Podsnap!' 
</p>
<p>
'My dear,' says Mr Veneering to Mrs Veneering, with an air of much 
friendly interest, while the door stands open, 'the Podsnaps.' 
</p>
<p>
A too, too smiling large man, with a fatal freshness on him, appearing 
with his wife, instantly deserts his wife and darts at Twemlow with: 
</p>
<p>
'How do you do? So glad to know you. Charming house you have here. I hope 
we are not late. So glad of the opportunity, I am sure!' 
</p>
<p>
When the first shock fell upon him, Twemlow twice skipped back in his neat 
little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone fashion, as if 
impelled to leap over a sofa behind him; but the large man closed with him 
and proved too strong. 
</p>
<p>
'Let me,' says the large man, trying to attract the attention of his wife 
in the distance, 'have the pleasure of presenting Mrs Podsnap to her host. 
She will be,' in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual verdure 
and eternal youth in the phrase, 'she will be so glad of the opportunity, 
I am sure!' 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Mrs Podsnap, unable to originate a mistake on her own 
account, because Mrs Veneering is the only other lady there, does her best 
in the way of handsomely supporting her husband's, by looking towards Mr 
Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and remarking to Mrs Veneering in a 
feeling manner, firstly, that she fears he has been rather bilious of 
late, and, secondly, that the baby is already very like him. 
</p>
<p>
It is questionable whether any man quite relishes being mistaken for any 
other man; but, Mr Veneering having this very evening set up the 
shirt-front of the young Antinous in new worked cambric just come home, is 
not at all complimented by being supposed to be Twemlow, who is dry and 
weazen and some thirty years older. Mrs Veneering equally resents the 
imputation of being the wife of Twemlow. As to Twemlow, he is so sensible 
of being a much better bred man than Veneering, that he considers the 
large man an offensive ass. 
</p>
<p>
In this complicated dilemma, Mr Veneering approaches the large man with 
extended hand and, smilingly assures that incorrigible personage that he 
is delighted to see him: who in his fatal freshness instantly replies: 
</p>
<p>
'Thank you. I am ashamed to say that I cannot at this moment recall where 
we met, but I am so glad of this opportunity, I am sure!' 
</p>
<p>
Then pouncing upon Twemlow, who holds back with all his feeble might, he 
is haling him off to present him, as Veneering, to Mrs Podsnap, when the 
arrival of more guests unravels the mistake. Whereupon, having re-shaken 
hands with Veneering as Veneering, he re-shakes hands with Twemlow as 
Twemlow, and winds it all up to his own perfect satisfaction by saying to 
the last-named, 'Ridiculous opportunity--but so glad of it, I am 
sure!' 
</p>
<p>
Now, Twemlow having undergone this terrific experience, having likewise 
noted the fusion of Boots in Brewer and Brewer in Boots, and having 
further observed that of the remaining seven guests four discrete 
characters enter with wandering eyes and wholly declined to commit 
themselves as to which is Veneering, until Veneering has them in his 
grasp;--Twemlow having profited by these studies, finds his brain 
wholesomely hardening as he approaches the conclusion that he really is 
Veneering's oldest friend, when his brain softens again and all is lost, 
through his eyes encountering Veneering and the large man linked together 
as twin brothers in the back drawing-room near the conservatory door, and 
through his ears informing him in the tones of Mrs Veneering that the same 
large man is to be baby's godfather. 
</p>
<p>
'Dinner is on the table!' 
</p>
<p>
Thus the melancholy retainer, as who should say, 'Come down and be 
poisoned, ye unhappy children of men!' 
</p>
<p>
Twemlow, having no lady assigned him, goes down in the rear, with his hand 
to his forehead. Boots and Brewer, thinking him indisposed, whisper, 'Man 
faint. Had no lunch.' But he is only stunned by the unvanquishable 
difficulty of his existence. 
</p>
<p>
Revived by soup, Twemlow discourses mildly of the Court Circular with 
Boots and Brewer. Is appealed to, at the fish stage of the banquet, by 
Veneering, on the disputed question whether his cousin Lord Snigsworth is 
in or out of town? Gives it that his cousin is out of town. 'At 
Snigsworthy Park?' Veneering inquires. 'At Snigsworthy,' Twemlow rejoins. 
Boots and Brewer regard this as a man to be cultivated; and Veneering is 
clear that he is a remunerative article. Meantime the retainer goes round, 
like a gloomy <smallcaps>Analytical Chemist</smallcaps>: always seeming to say, after 'Chablis, 
sir?'--'You wouldn't if you knew what it's made of.' 
</p>
<p>
The great looking-glass above the sideboard, reflects the table and the 
company. Reflects the new Veneering crest, in gold and eke in silver, 
frosted and also thawed, a camel of all work. The Heralds' College found 
out a Crusading ancestor for Veneering who bore a camel on his shield (or 
might have done it if he had thought of it), and a caravan of camels take 
charge of the fruits and flowers and candles, and kneel down to be loaded 
with the salt. Reflects Veneering; forty, wavy-haired, dark, tending to 
corpulence, sly, mysterious, filmy--a kind of sufficiently 
well-looking veiled-prophet, not prophesying. Reflects Mrs Veneering; 
fair, aquiline-nosed and fingered, not so much light hair as she might 
have, gorgeous in raiment and jewels, enthusiastic, propitiatory, 
conscious that a corner of her husband's veil is over herself. Reflects 
Podsnap; prosperously feeding, two little light-coloured wiry wings, one 
on either side of his else bald head, looking as like his hairbrushes as 
his hair, dissolving view of red beads on his forehead, large allowance of 
crumpled shirt-collar up behind. Reflects Mrs Podsnap; fine woman for 
Professor Owen, quantity of bone, neck and nostrils like a rocking-horse, 
hard features, majestic head-dress in which Podsnap has hung golden 
offerings. Reflects Twemlow; grey, dry, polite, susceptible to east wind, 
First-Gentleman-in-Europe collar and cravat, cheeks drawn in as if he had 
made a great effort to retire into himself some years ago, and had got so 
far and had never got any farther. Reflects mature young lady; raven 
locks, and complexion that lights up well when well powdered--as it 
is--carrying on considerably in the captivation of mature young 
gentleman; with too much nose in his face, too much ginger in his 
whiskers, too much torso in his waistcoat, too much sparkle in his studs, 
his eyes, his buttons, his talk, and his teeth. Reflects charming old Lady 
Tippins on Veneering's right; with an immense obtuse drab oblong face, 
like a face in a tablespoon, and a dyed Long Walk up the top of her head, 
as a convenient public approach to the bunch of false hair behind, pleased 
to patronize Mrs Veneering opposite, who is pleased to be patronized. 
Reflects a certain 'Mortimer', another of Veneering's oldest friends; who 
never was in the house before, and appears not to want to come again, who 
sits disconsolate on Mrs Veneering's left, and who was inveigled by Lady 
Tippins (a friend of his boyhood) to come to these people's and talk, and 
who won't talk. Reflects Eugene, friend of Mortimer; buried alive in the 
back of his chair, behind a shoulder--with a powder-epaulette on it--of 
the mature young lady, and gloomily resorting to the champagne chalice 
whenever proffered by the Analytical Chemist. Lastly, the looking-glass 
reflects Boots and Brewer, and two other stuffed Buffers interposed 
between the rest of the company and possible accidents. 
</p>
<p>
The Veneering dinners are excellent dinners--or new people wouldn't 
come--and all goes well. Notably, Lady Tippins has made a series of 
experiments on her digestive functions, so extremely complicated and 
daring, that if they could be published with their results it might 
benefit the human race. Having taken in provisions from all parts of the 
world, this hardy old cruiser has last touched at the North Pole, when, as 
the ice-plates are being removed, the following words fall from her: 
</p>
<p>
'I assure you, my dear Veneering--' 
</p>
<p>
(Poor Twemlow's hand approaches his forehead, for it would seem now, that 
Lady Tippins is going to be the oldest friend.) 
</p>
<p>
'I assure you, my dear Veneering, that it is the oddest affair! Like the 
advertising people, I don't ask you to trust me, without offering a 
respectable reference. Mortimer there, is my reference, and knows all 
about it.' 
</p>
<p>
Mortimer raises his drooping eyelids, and slightly opens his mouth. But a 
faint smile, expressive of 'What's the use!' passes over his face, and he 
drops his eyelids and shuts his mouth. 
</p>
<p>
'Now, Mortimer,' says Lady Tippins, rapping the sticks of her closed green 
fan upon the knuckles of her left hand--which is particularly rich in 
knuckles, 'I insist upon your telling all that is to be told about the man 
from Jamaica.' 
</p>
<p>
'Give you my honour I never heard of any man from Jamaica, except the man 
who was a brother,' replies Mortimer. 
</p>
<p>
'Tobago, then.' 
</p>
<p>
'Nor yet from Tobago.' 
</p>
<p>
'Except,' Eugene strikes in: so unexpectedly that the mature young lady, 
who has forgotten all about him, with a start takes the epaulette out of 
his way: 'except our friend who long lived on rice-pudding and isinglass, 
till at length to his something or other, his physician said something 
else, and a leg of mutton somehow ended in daygo.' 
</p>
<p>
A reviving impression goes round the table that Eugene is coming out. An 
unfulfilled impression, for he goes in again. 
</p>
<p>
'Now, my dear Mrs Veneering,' quoth Lady Tippins, I appeal to you whether 
this is not the basest conduct ever known in this world? I carry my lovers 
about, two or three at a time, on condition that they are very obedient 
and devoted; and here is my oldest lover-in-chief, the head of all my 
slaves, throwing off his allegiance before company! And here is another of 
my lovers, a rough Cymon at present certainly, but of whom I had most 
hopeful expectations as to his turning out well in course of time, 
pretending that he can't remember his nursery rhymes! On purpose to annoy 
me, for he knows how I doat upon them!' 
</p>
<p>
A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is Lady Tippins's point. She 
is always attended by a lover or two, and she keeps a little list of her 
lovers, and she is always booking a new lover, or striking out an old 
lover, or putting a lover in her black list, or promoting a lover to her 
blue list, or adding up her lovers, or otherwise posting her book. Mrs 
Veneering is charmed by the humour, and so is Veneering. Perhaps it is 
enhanced by a certain yellow play in Lady Tippins's throat, like the legs 
of scratching poultry. 
</p>
<p>
'I banish the false wretch from this moment, and I strike him out of my 
Cupidon (my name for my Ledger, my dear,) this very night. But I am 
resolved to have the account of the man from Somewhere, and I beg you to 
elicit it for me, my love,' to Mrs Veneering, 'as I have lost my own 
influence. Oh, you perjured man!' This to Mortimer, with a rattle of her 
fan. 
</p>
<p>
'We are all very much interested in the man from Somewhere,' Veneering 
observes. 
</p>
<p>
Then the four Buffers, taking heart of grace all four at once, say: 
</p>
<p>
'Deeply interested!' 
</p>
<p>
'Quite excited!' 
</p>
<p>
'Dramatic!' 
</p>
<p>
'Man from Nowhere, perhaps!' 
</p>
<p>
And then Mrs Veneering--for the Lady Tippins's winning wiles are 
contagious--folds her hands in the manner of a supplicating child, 
turns to her left neighbour, and says, 'Tease! Pay! Man from Tumwhere!' At 
which the four Buffers, again mysteriously moved all four at once, 
explain, 'You can't resist!' 
</p>
<p>
'Upon my life,' says Mortimer languidly, 'I find it immensely embarrassing 
to have the eyes of Europe upon me to this extent, and my only consolation 
is that you will all of you execrate Lady Tippins in your secret hearts 
when you find, as you inevitably will, the man from Somewhere a bore. 
Sorry to destroy romance by fixing him with a local habitation, but he 
comes from the place, the name of which escapes me, but will suggest 
itself to everybody else here, where they make the wine.' 
</p>
<p>
Eugene suggests '<smallcaps>Day and Martin's</smallcaps>.' 
</p>
<p>
'No, not that place,' returns the unmoved Mortimer, 'that's where they 
make the Port. My man comes from the country where they make the Cape 
Wine. But look here, old fellow; its not at all statistical and it's 
rather odd.' 
</p>
<p>
It is always noticeable at the table of the Veneerings, that no man 
troubles himself much about the Veneerings themselves, and that any one 
who has anything to tell, generally tells it to anybody else in 
preference. 
</p>
<p>
'The man,' Mortimer goes on, addressing Eugene, 'whose name is Harmon, was 
only son of a tremendous old rascal who made his money by Dust.' 
</p>
<p>
'Red velveteens and a bell?' the gloomy Eugene inquires. 
</p>
<p>
'And a ladder and basket if you like. By which means, or by others, he 
grew rich as a Dust Contractor, and lived in a hollow in a hilly country 
entirely composed of Dust. On his own small estate the growling old 
vagabond threw up his own mountain range, like an old volcano, and its 
geological formation was Dust. Coal-dust, vegetable-dust, bone-dust, 
crockery dust, rough dust and sifted dust,--all manner of Dust.' 
</p>
<p>
A passing remembrance of Mrs Veneering, here induces Mortimer to address 
his next half-dozen words to her; after which he wanders away again, tries 
Twemlow and finds he doesn't answer, ultimately takes up with the Buffers 
who receive him enthusiastically. 
</p>
<p>
'The moral being--I believe that's the right expression--of this 
exemplary person, derived its highest gratification from anathematizing 
his nearest relations and turning them out of doors. Having begun (as was 
natural) by rendering these attentions to the wife of his bosom, he next 
found himself at leisure to bestow a similar recognition on the claims of 
his daughter. He chose a husband for her, entirely to his own satisfaction 
and not in the least to hers, and proceeded to settle upon her, as her 
marriage portion, I don't know how much Dust, but something immense. At 
this stage of the affair the poor girl respectfully intimated that she was 
secretly engaged to that popular character whom the novelists and 
versifiers call Another, and that such a marriage would make Dust of her 
heart and Dust of her life--in short, would set her up, on a very 
extensive scale, in her father's business. Immediately, the venerable 
parent--on a cold winter's night, it is said--anathematized and 
turned her out.' 
</p>
<p>
Here, the Analytical Chemist (who has evidently formed a very low opinion 
of Mortimer's story) concedes a little claret to the Buffers; who, again 
mysteriously moved all four at once, screw it slowly into themselves with 
a peculiar twist of enjoyment, as they cry in chorus, 'Pray go on.' 
</p>
<p>
'The pecuniary resources of Another were, as they usually are, of a very 
limited nature. I believe I am not using too strong an expression when I 
say that Another was hard up. However, he married the young lady, and they 
lived in a humble dwelling, probably possessing a porch ornamented with 
honeysuckle and woodbine twining, until she died. I must refer you to the 
Registrar of the District in which the humble dwelling was situated, for 
the certified cause of death; but early sorrow and anxiety may have had to 
do with it, though they may not appear in the ruled pages and printed 
forms. Indisputably this was the case with Another, for he was so cut up 
by the loss of his young wife that if he outlived her a year it was as 
much as he did.' 
</p>
<p>
There is that in the indolent Mortimer, which seems to hint that if good 
society might on any account allow itself to be impressible, he, one of 
good society, might have the weakness to be impressed by what he here 
relates. It is hidden with great pains, but it is in him. The gloomy 
Eugene too, is not without some kindred touch; for, when that appalling 
Lady Tippins declares that if Another had survived, he should have gone 
down at the head of her list of lovers--and also when the mature 
young lady shrugs her epaulettes, and laughs at some private and 
confidential comment from the mature young gentleman--his gloom 
deepens to that degree that he trifles quite ferociously with his 
dessert-knife. 
</p>
<p>
Mortimer proceeds. 
</p>
<p>
'We must now return, as novelists say, and as we all wish they wouldn't, 
to the man from Somewhere. Being a boy of fourteen, cheaply educated at 
Brussels when his sister's expulsion befell, it was some little time 
before he heard of it--probably from herself, for the mother was 
dead; but that I don't know. Instantly, he absconded, and came over here. 
He must have been a boy of spirit and resource, to get here on a stopped 
allowance of five sous a week; but he did it somehow, and he burst in on 
his father, and pleaded his sister's cause. Venerable parent promptly 
resorts to anathematization, and turns him out. Shocked and terrified boy 
takes flight, seeks his fortune, gets aboard ship, ultimately turns up on 
dry land among the Cape wine: small proprietor, farmer, grower--whatever 
you like to call it.' 
</p>
<p>
At this juncture, shuffling is heard in the hall, and tapping is heard at 
the dining-room door. Analytical Chemist goes to the door, confers angrily 
with unseen tapper, appears to become mollified by descrying reason in the 
tapping, and goes out. 
</p>
<p>
'So he was discovered, only the other day, after having been expatriated 
about fourteen years.' 
</p>
<p>
A Buffer, suddenly astounding the other three, by detaching himself, and 
asserting individuality, inquires: 'How discovered, and why?' 
</p>
<p>
'Ah! To be sure. Thank you for reminding me. Venerable parent dies.' 
</p>
<p>
Same Buffer, emboldened by success, says: 'When?' 
</p>
<p>
'The other day. Ten or twelve months ago.' 
</p>
<p>
Same Buffer inquires with smartness, 'What of?' But herein perishes a 
melancholy example; being regarded by the three other Buffers with a stony 
stare, and attracting no further attention from any mortal. 
</p>
<p>
'Venerable parent,' Mortimer repeats with a passing remembrance that there 
is a Veneering at table, and for the first time addressing him--'dies.' 
</p>
<p>
The gratified Veneering repeats, gravely, 'dies'; and folds his arms, and 
composes his brow to hear it out in a judicial manner, when he finds 
himself again deserted in the bleak world. 
</p>
<p>
'His will is found,' said Mortimer, catching Mrs Podsnap's rocking-horse's 
eye. 'It is dated very soon after the son's flight. It leaves the lowest 
of the range of dust-mountains, with some sort of a dwelling-house at its 
foot, to an old servant who is sole executor, and all the rest of the 
property--which is very considerable--to the son. He directs 
himself to be buried with certain eccentric ceremonies and precautions 
against his coming to life, with which I need not bore you, and that's all--except--' 
and this ends the story. 
</p>
<p>
The Analytical Chemist returning, everybody looks at him. Not because 
anybody wants to see him, but because of that subtle influence in nature 
which impels humanity to embrace the slightest opportunity of looking at 
anything, rather than the person who addresses it. 
</p>
<p>
'--Except that the son's inheriting is made conditional on his 
marrying a girl, who at the date of the will, was a child of four or five 
years old, and who is now a marriageable young woman. Advertisement and 
inquiry discovered the son in the man from Somewhere, and at the present 
moment, he is on his way home from there--no doubt, in a state of 
great astonishment--to succeed to a very large fortune, and to take a 
wife.' 
</p>
<p>
Mrs Podsnap inquires whether the young person is a young person of 
personal charms? Mortimer is unable to report. 
</p>
<p>
Mr Podsnap inquires what would become of the very large fortune, in the 
event of the marriage condition not being fulfilled? Mortimer replies, 
that by special testamentary clause it would then go to the old servant 
above mentioned, passing over and excluding the son; also, that if the son 
had not been living, the same old servant would have been sole residuary 
legatee. 
</p>
<p>
Mrs Veneering has just succeeded in waking Lady Tippins from a snore, by 
dexterously shunting a train of plates and dishes at her knuckles across 
the table; when everybody but Mortimer himself becomes aware that the 
Analytical Chemist is, in a ghostly manner, offering him a folded paper. 
Curiosity detains Mrs Veneering a few moments. 
</p>
<p>
Mortimer, in spite of all the arts of the chemist, placidly refreshes 
himself with a glass of Madeira, and remains unconscious of the Document 
which engrosses the general attention, until Lady Tippins (who has a habit 
of waking totally insensible), having remembered where she is, and 
recovered a perception of surrounding objects, says: 'Falser man than Don 
Juan; why don't you take the note from the commendatore?' Upon which, the 
chemist advances it under the nose of Mortimer, who looks round at him, 
and says: 
</p>
<p>
'What's this?' 
</p>
<p>
Analytical Chemist bends and whispers. 
</p>
<p>
'<i>Who</i>?' Says Mortimer. 
</p>
<p>
Analytical Chemist again bends and whispers. 
</p>
<p>
Mortimer stares at him, and unfolds the paper. Reads it, reads it twice, 
turns it over to look at the blank outside, reads it a third time. 
</p>
<p>
'This arrives in an extraordinarily opportune manner,' says Mortimer then, 
looking with an altered face round the table: 'this is the conclusion of 
the story of the identical man.' 
</p>
<p>
'Already married?' one guesses. 
</p>
<p>
'Declines to marry?' another guesses. 
</p>
<p>
'Codicil among the dust?' another guesses. 
</p>
<p>
'Why, no,' says Mortimer; 'remarkable thing, you are all wrong. The story 
is completer and rather more exciting than I supposed. Man's drowned!'

<title>Of An Educational Character</title>
</info>
<p>
The school at which young Charley Hexam had first learned from a book--the 
streets being, for pupils of his degree, the great Preparatory 
Establishment in which very much that is never unlearned is learned 
without and before book--was a miserable loft in an unsavoury yard. 
Its atmosphere was oppressive and disagreeable; it was crowded, noisy, and 
confusing; half the pupils dropped asleep, or fell into a state of waking 
stupefaction; the other half kept them in either condition by maintaining 
a monotonous droning noise, as if they were performing, out of time and 
tune, on a ruder sort of bagpipe. The teachers, animated solely by good 
intentions, had no idea of execution, and a lamentable jumble was the 
upshot of their kind endeavours. 
</p>
<p>
It was a school for all ages, and for both sexes. The latter were kept 
apart, and the former were partitioned off into square assortments. But, 
all the place was pervaded by a grimly ludicrous pretence that every pupil 
was childish and innocent. This pretence, much favoured by the 
lady-visitors, led to the ghastliest absurdities. Young women old in the 
vices of the commonest and worst life, were expected to profess themselves 
enthralled by the good child's book, the Adventures of Little Margery, who 
resided in the village cottage by the mill; severely reproved and morally 
squashed the miller, when she was five and he was fifty; divided her 
porridge with singing birds; denied herself a new nankeen bonnet, on the 
ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen bonnets, neither did the 
sheep who ate them; who plaited straw and delivered the dreariest orations 
to all comers, at all sorts of unseasonable times. So, unwieldy young 
dredgers and hulking mudlarks were referred to the experiences of Thomas 
Twopence, who, having resolved not to rob (under circumstances of uncommon 
atrocity) his particular friend and benefactor, of eighteenpence, 
presently came into supernatural possession of three and sixpence, and 
lived a shining light ever afterwards. (Note, that the benefactor came to 
no good.) Several swaggering sinners had written their own biographies in 
the same strain; it always appearing from the lessons of those very 
boastful persons, that you were to do good, not because it <i>was </i>good, but 
because you were to make a good thing of it. Contrariwise, the adult 
pupils were taught to read (if they could learn) out of the New Testament; 
and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered 
eyes on the particular syllables coming round to their turn, were as 
absolutely ignorant of the sublime history, as if they had never seen or 
heard of it. An exceedingly and confoundingly perplexing jumble of a 
school, in fact, where black spirits and grey, red spirits and white, 
jumbled jumbled jumbled jumbled, jumbled every night. And particularly 
every Sunday night. For then, an inclined plane of unfortunate infants 
would be handed over to the prosiest and worst of all the teachers with 
good intentions, whom nobody older would endure. Who, taking his stand on 
the floor before them as chief executioner, would be attended by a 
conventional volunteer boy as executioner's assistant. When and where it 
first became the conventional system that a weary or inattentive infant in 
a class must have its face smoothed downward with a hot hand, or when and 
where the conventional volunteer boy first beheld such system in 
operation, and became inflamed with a sacred zeal to administer it, 
matters not. It was the function of the chief executioner to hold forth, 
and it was the function of the acolyte to dart at sleeping infants, 
yawning infants, restless infants, whimpering infants, and smooth their 
wretched faces; sometimes with one hand, as if he were anointing them for 
a whisker; sometimes with both hands, applied after the fashion of 
blinkers. And so the jumble would be in action in this department for a 
mortal hour; the exponent drawling on to My Dearert Childerrenerr, let us 
say, for example, about the beautiful coming to the Sepulchre; and 
repeating the word Sepulchre (commonly used among infants) five hundred 
times, and never once hinting what it meant; the conventional boy 
smoothing away right and left, as an infallible commentary; the whole 
hot-bed of flushed and exhausted infants exchanging measles, rashes, 
whooping-cough, fever, and stomach disorders, as if they were assembled in 
High Market for the purpose. 
</p>
<p>
Even in this temple of good intentions, an exceptionally sharp boy 
exceptionally determined to learn, could learn something, and, having 
learned it, could impart it much better than the teachers; as being more 
knowing than they, and not at the disadvantage in which they stood towards 
the shrewder pupils. In this way it had come about that Charley Hexam had 
risen in the jumble, taught in the jumble, and been received from the 
jumble into a better school. 
</p>
<p>
'So you want to go and see your sister, Hexam?' 
</p>
<p>
'If you please, Mr Headstone.' 
</p>
<p>
'I have half a mind to go with you. Where does your sister live?' 
</p>
<p>
'Why, she is not settled yet, Mr Headstone. I'd rather you didn't see her 
till she is settled, if it was all the same to you.' 
</p>
<p>
'Look here, Hexam.' Mr Bradley Headstone, highly certificated stipendiary 
schoolmaster, drew his right forefinger through one of the buttonholes of 
the boy's coat, and looked at it attentively. 'I hope your sister may be 
good company for you?' 
</p>
<p>
'Why do you doubt it, Mr Headstone?' 
</p>
<p>
'I did not say I doubted it.' 
</p>
<p>
'No, sir; you didn't say so.' 
</p>
<p>
Bradley Headstone looked at his finger again, took it out of the 
buttonhole and looked at it closer, bit the side of it and looked at it 
again. 
</p>
<p>
'You see, Hexam, you will be one of us. In good time you are sure to pass 
a creditable examination and become one of us. Then the question is--' 
</p>
<p>
The boy waited so long for the question, while the schoolmaster looked at 
a new side of his finger, and bit it, and looked at it again, that at 
length the boy repeated: 
</p>
<p>
'The question is, sir--?' 
</p>
<p>
'Whether you had not better leave well alone.' 
</p>
<p>
'Is it well to leave my sister alone, Mr Headstone?' 
</p>
<p>
'I do not say so, because I do not know. I put it to you. I ask you to 
think of it. I want you to consider. You know how well you are doing 
here.' 
</p>
<p>
'After all, she got me here,' said the boy, with a struggle. 
</p>
<p>
'Perceiving the necessity of it,' acquiesced the schoolmaster, 'and making 
up her mind fully to the separation. Yes.' 
</p>
<p>
The boy, with a return of that former reluctance or struggle or whatever 
it was, seemed to debate with himself. At length he said, raising his eyes 
to the master's face: 
</p>
<p>
'I wish you'd come with me and see her, Mr Headstone, though she is not 
settled. I wish you'd come with me, and take her in the rough, and judge 
her for yourself.' 
</p>
<p>
'You are sure you would not like,' asked the schoolmaster, 'to prepare 
her?' 
</p>
<p>
'My sister Lizzie,' said the boy, proudly, 'wants no preparing, Mr 
Headstone. What she is, she is, and shows herself to be. There's no 
pretending about my sister.' 
</p>
<p>
His confidence in her, sat more easily upon him than the indecision with 
which he had twice contended. It was his better nature to be true to her, 
if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish. And as yet the better 
nature had the stronger hold. 
</p>
<p>
'Well, I can spare the evening,' said the schoolmaster. 'I am ready to 
walk with you.' 
</p>
<p>
'Thank you, Mr Headstone. And I am ready to go.' 
</p>
<p>
Bradley Headstone, in his decent black coat and waistcoat, and decent 
white shirt, and decent formal black tie, and decent pantaloons of pepper 
and salt, with his decent silver watch in his pocket and its decent 
hair-guard round his neck, looked a thoroughly decent young man of 
six-and-twenty. He was never seen in any other dress, and yet there was a 
certain stiffness in his manner of wearing this, as if there were a want 
of adaptation between him and it, recalling some mechanics in their 
holiday clothes. He had acquired mechanically a great store of teacher's 
knowledge. He could do mental arithmetic mechanically, sing at sight 
mechanically, blow various wind instruments mechanically, even play the 
great church organ mechanically. From his early childhood up, his mind had 
been a place of mechanical stowage. The arrangement of his wholesale 
warehouse, so that it might be always ready to meet the demands of retail 
dealers history here, geography there, astronomy to the right, political 
economy to the left--natural history, the physical sciences, figures, 
music, the lower mathematics, and what not, all in their several places--this 
care had imparted to his countenance a look of care; while the habit of 
questioning and being questioned had given him a suspicious manner, or a 
manner that would be better described as one of lying in wait. There was a 
kind of settled trouble in the face. It was the face belonging to a 
naturally slow or inattentive intellect that had toiled hard to get what 
it had won, and that had to hold it now that it was gotten. He always 
seemed to be uneasy lest anything should be missing from his mental 
warehouse, and taking stock to assure himself. 
</p>
<p>
Suppression of so much to make room for so much, had given him a 
constrained manner, over and above. Yet there was enough of what was 
animal, and of what was fiery (though smouldering), still visible in him, 
to suggest that if young Bradley Headstone, when a pauper lad, had chanced 
to be told off for the sea, he would not have been the last man in a 
ship's crew. Regarding that origin of his, he was proud, moody, and 
sullen, desiring it to be forgotten. And few people knew of it. 
</p>
<p>
In some visits to the Jumble his attention had been attracted to this boy 
Hexam. An undeniable boy for a pupil-teacher; an undeniable boy to do 
credit to the master who should bring him on. Combined with this 
consideration, there may have been some thought of the pauper lad now 
never to be mentioned. Be that how it might, he had with pains gradually 
worked the boy into his own school, and procured him some offices to 
discharge there, which were repaid with food and lodging. Such were the 
circumstances that had brought together, Bradley Headstone and young 
Charley Hexam that autumn evening. Autumn, because full half a year had 
come and gone since the bird of prey lay dead upon the river-shore. 
</p>
<p>
The schools--for they were twofold, as the sexes--were down in 
that district of the flat country tending to the Thames, where Kent and 
Surrey meet, and where the railways still bestride the market-gardens that 
will soon die under them. The schools were newly built, and there were so 
many like them all over the country, that one might have thought the whole 
were but one restless edifice with the locomotive gift of Aladdin's 
palace. They were in a neighbourhood which looked like a toy neighbourhood 
taken in blocks out of a box by a child of particularly incoherent mind, 
and set up anyhow; here, one side of a new street; there, a large solitary 
public-house facing nowhere; here, another unfinished street already in 
ruins; there, a church; here, an immense new warehouse; there, a 
dilapidated old country villa; then, a medley of black ditch, sparkling 
cucumber-frame, rank field, richly cultivated kitchen-garden, brick 
viaduct, arch-spanned canal, and disorder of frowziness and fog. As if the 
child had given the table a kick, and gone to sleep. 
</p>
<p>
But, even among school-buildings, school-teachers, and school-pupils, all 
according to pattern and all engendered in the light of the latest Gospel 
according to Monotony, the older pattern into which so many fortunes have 
been shaped for good and evil, comes out. It came out in Miss Peecher the 
schoolmistress, watering her flowers, as Mr Bradley Headstone walked 
forth. It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress, watering the 
flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her small official 
residence, with little windows like the eyes in needles, and little doors 
like the covers of school-books. 
</p>
<p>
Small, shining, neat, methodical, and buxom was Miss Peecher; 
cherry-cheeked and tuneful of voice. A little pincushion, a little 
housewife, a little book, a little workbox, a little set of tables and 
weights and measures, and a little woman, all in one. She could write a 
little essay on any subject, exactly a slate long, beginning at the 
left-hand top of one side and ending at the right-hand bottom of the 
other, and the essay should be strictly according to rule. If Mr Bradley 
Headstone had addressed a written proposal of marriage to her, she would 
probably have replied in a complete little essay on the theme exactly a 
slate long, but would certainly have replied Yes. For she loved him. The 
decent hair-guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent 
silver watch was an object of envy to her. So would Miss Peecher have gone 
round his neck and taken care of him. Of him, insensible. Because he did 
not love Miss Peecher. 
</p>
<p>
Miss Peecher's favourite pupil, who assisted her in her little household, 
was in attendance with a can of water to replenish her little 
watering-pot, and sufficiently divined the state of Miss Peecher's 
affections to feel it necessary that she herself should love young Charley 
Hexam. So, there was a double palpitation among the double stocks and 
double wall-flowers, when the master and the boy looked over the little 
gate. 
</p>
<p>
'A fine evening, Miss Peecher,' said the Master. 
</p>
<p>
'A very fine evening, Mr Headstone,' said Miss Peecher. 'Are you taking a 
walk?' 
</p>
<p>
'Hexam and I are going to take a long walk.' 
</p>
<p>
'Charming weather,' remarked Miss Peecher, '<i>for </i>a long walk.' 
</p>
<p>
'Ours is rather on business than mere pleasure,' said the Master. Miss 
Peecher inverting her watering-pot, and very carefully shaking out the few 
last drops over a flower, as if there were some special virtue in them 
which would make it a Jack's beanstalk before morning, called for 
replenishment to her pupil, who had been speaking to the boy. 
</p>
<p>
'Good-night, Miss Peecher,' said the Master. 
</p>
<p>
'Good-night, Mr Headstone,' said the Mistress. 
</p>
<p>
The pupil had been, in her state of pupilage, so imbued with the 
class-custom of stretching out an arm, as if to hail a cab or omnibus, 
whenever she found she had an observation on hand to offer to Miss 
Peecher, that she often did it in their domestic relations; and she did it 
now. 
</p>
<p>
'Well, Mary Anne?' said Miss Peecher. 
</p>
<p>
'If you please, ma'am, Hexam said they were going to see his sister.' 
</p>
<p>
'But that can't be, I think,' returned Miss Peecher: 'because Mr Headstone 
can have no business with <i>her</i>.' 
</p>
<p>
Mary Anne again hailed. 
</p>
<p>
'Well, Mary Anne?' 
</p>
<p>
'If you please, ma'am, perhaps it's Hexam's business?' 
</p>
<p>
'That may be,' said Miss Peecher. 'I didn't think of that. Not that it 
matters at all.' 
</p>
<p>
Mary Anne again hailed. 
</p>
<p>
'Well, Mary Anne?' 
</p>
<p>
'They say she's very handsome.' 
</p>
<p>
'Oh, Mary Anne, Mary Anne!' returned Miss Peecher, slightly colouring and 
shaking her head, a little out of humour; 'how often have I told you not 
to use that vague expression, not to speak in that general way? When you 
say <i>they </i>say, what do you mean? Part of speech They?' 
</p>
<p>
Mary Anne hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand, as being under 
examination, and replied: 
</p>
<p>
'Personal pronoun.' 
</p>
<p>
'Person, They?' 
</p>
<p>
'Third person.' 
</p>
<p>
'Number, They?' 
</p>
<p>
'Plural number.' 
</p>
<p>
'Then how many do you mean, Mary Anne? Two? Or more?' 
</p>
<p>
'I beg your pardon, ma'am,' said Mary Anne, disconcerted now she came to 
think of it; 'but I don't know that I mean more than her brother himself.' 
As she said it, she unhooked her arm. 
</p>
<p>
'I felt convinced of it,' returned Miss Peecher, smiling again. 'Now pray, 
Mary Anne, be careful another time. He says is very different from they 
say, remember. Difference between he says and they say? Give it me.' 
</p>
<p>
Mary Anne immediately hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand--an 
attitude absolutely necessary to the situation--and replied: 'One is 
indicative mood, present tense, third person singular, verb active to say. 
Other is indicative mood, present tense, third person plural, verb active 
to say.' 
</p>
<p>
'Why verb active, Mary Anne?' 
</p>
<p>
'Because it takes a pronoun after it in the objective case, Miss Peecher.' 
</p>
<p>
'Very good indeed,' remarked Miss Peecher, with encouragement. 'In fact, 
could not be better. Don't forget to apply it, another time, Mary Anne.' 
This said, Miss Peecher finished the watering of her flowers, and went 
into her little official residence, and took a refresher of the principal 
rivers and mountains of the world, their breadths, depths, and heights, 
before settling the measurements of the body of a dress for her own 
personal occupation. 
</p>
<p>
Bradley Headstone and Charley Hexam duly got to the Surrey side of 
Westminster Bridge, and crossed the bridge, and made along the Middlesex 
shore towards Millbank. In this region are a certain little street called 
Church Street, and a certain little blind square, called Smith Square, in 
the centre of which last retreat is a very hideous church with four towers 
at the four corners, generally resembling some petrified monster, 
frightful and gigantic, on its back with its legs in the air. They found a 
tree near by in a corner, and a blacksmith's forge, and a timber yard, and 
a dealer's in old iron. What a rusty portion of a boiler and a great iron 
wheel or so meant by lying half-buried in the dealer's fore-court, nobody 
seemed to know or to want to know. Like the Miller of questionable jollity 
in the song, They cared for Nobody, no not they, and Nobody cared for 
them. 
</p>
<p>
After making the round of this place, and noting that there was a deadly 
kind of repose on it, more as though it had taken laudanum than fallen 
into a natural rest, they stopped at the point where the street and the 
square joined, and where there were some little quiet houses in a row. To 
these Charley Hexam finally led the way, and at one of these stopped. 
</p>
<p>
'This must be where my sister lives, sir. This is where she came for a 
temporary lodging, soon after father's death.' 
</p>
<p>
'How often have you seen her since?' 
</p>
<p>
'Why, only twice, sir,' returned the boy, with his former reluctance; 'but 
that's as much her doing as mine.' 
</p>
<p>
'How does she support herself?' 
</p>
<p>
'She was always a fair needlewoman, and she keeps the stockroom of a 
seaman's outfitter.' 
</p>
<p>
'Does she ever work at her own lodging here?' 
</p>
<p>
'Sometimes; but her regular hours and regular occupation are at their 
place of business, I believe, sir. This is the number.' 
</p>
<p>
The boy knocked at a door, and the door promptly opened with a spring and 
a click. A parlour door within a small entry stood open, and disclosed a 
child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a 
little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working 
bench before it. 
</p>
<p>
'I can't get up,' said the child, 'because my back's bad, and my legs are 
queer. But I'm the person of the house.' 
</p>
<p>
'Who else is at home?' asked Charley Hexam, staring. 
</p>
<p>
'Nobody's at home at present,' returned the child, with a glib assertion 
of her dignity, 'except the person of the house. What did you want, young 
man?' 
</p>
<p>
'I wanted to see my sister.' 
</p>
<p>
'Many young men have sisters,' returned the child. 'Give me your name, 
young man?' 
</p>
<p>
The queer little figure, and the queer but not ugly little face, with its 
bright grey eyes, were so sharp, that the sharpness of the manner seemed 
unavoidable. As if, being turned out of that mould, it must be sharp. 
</p>
<p>
'Hexam is my name.' 
</p>
<p>
'Ah, indeed?' said the person of the house. 'I thought it might be. Your 
sister will be in, in about a quarter of an hour. I am very fond of your 
sister. She's my particular friend. Take a seat. And this gentleman's 
name?' 
</p>
<p>
'Mr Headstone, my schoolmaster.' 
</p>
<p>
'Take a seat. And would you please to shut the street door first? I can't 
very well do it myself; because my back's so bad, and my legs are so 
queer.' 
</p>
<p>
They complied in silence, and the little figure went on with its work of 
gumming or gluing together with a camel's-hair brush certain pieces of 
cardboard and thin wood, previously cut into various shapes. The scissors 
and knives upon the bench showed that the child herself had cut them; and 
the bright scraps of velvet and silk and ribbon also strewn upon the bench 
showed that when duly stuffed (and stuffing too was there), she was to 
cover them smartly. The dexterity of her nimble fingers was remarkable, 
and, as she brought two thin edges accurately together by giving them a 
little bite, she would glance at the visitors out of the corners of her 
grey eyes with a look that out-sharpened all her other sharpness. 
</p>
<p>
'You can't tell me the name of my trade, I'll be bound,' she said, after 
taking several of these observations. 
</p>
<p>
'You make pincushions,' said Charley. 
</p>
<p>
'What else do I make?' 
</p>
<p>
'Pen-wipers,' said Bradley Headstone. 
</p>
<p>
'Ha! ha! What else do I make? You're a schoolmaster, but you can't tell 
me.' 
</p>
<p>
'You do something,' he returned, pointing to a corner of the little bench, 
'with straw; but I don't know what.' 
</p>
<p>
'Well done you!' cried the person of the house. 'I only make pincushions 
and pen-wipers, to use up my waste. But my straw really does belong to my 
business. Try again. What do I make with my straw?' 
</p>
<p>
'Dinner-mats?' 
</p>
<p>
'A schoolmaster, and says dinner-mats! I'll give you a clue to my trade, 
in a game of forfeits. I love my love with a B because she's Beautiful; I 
hate my love with a B because she is Brazen; I took her to the sign of the 
Blue Boar, and I treated her with Bonnets; her name's Bouncer, and she 
lives in Bedlam.--Now, what do I make with my straw?' 
</p>
<p>
'Ladies' bonnets?' 
</p>
<p>
'Fine ladies',' said the person of the house, nodding assent. 'Dolls'. I'm 
a Doll's Dressmaker.' 
</p>
<p>
'I hope it's a good business?' 
</p>
<p>
The person of the house shrugged her shoulders and shook her head. 'No. 
Poorly paid. And I'm often so pressed for time! I had a doll married, last 
week, and was obliged to work all night. And it's not good for me, on 
account of my back being so bad and my legs so queer.' 
</p>
<p>
They looked at the little creature with a wonder that did not diminish, 
and the schoolmaster said: 'I am sorry your fine ladies are so 
inconsiderate.' 
</p>
<p>
'It's the way with them,' said the person of the house, shrugging her 
shoulders again. 'And they take no care of their clothes, and they never 
keep to the same fashions a month. I work for a doll with three daughters. 
Bless you, she's enough to ruin her husband!' The person of the house gave 
a weird little laugh here, and gave them another look out of the corners 
of her eyes. She had an elfin chin that was capable of great expression; 
and whenever she gave this look, she hitched this chin up. As if her eyes 
and her chin worked together on the same wires. 
</p>
<p>
'Are you always as busy as you are now?' 
</p>
<p>
'Busier. I'm slack just now. I finished a large mourning order the day 
before yesterday. Doll I work for, lost a canary-bird.' The person of the 
house gave another little laugh, and then nodded her head several times, 
as who should moralize, 'Oh this world, this world!' 
</p>
<p>
'Are you alone all day?' asked Bradley Headstone. 'Don't any of the 
neighbouring children--?' 
</p>
<p>
'Ah, lud!' cried the person of the house, with a little scream, as if the 
word had pricked her. 'Don't talk of children. I can't bear children. I 
know their tricks and their manners.' She said this with an angry little 
shake of her tight fist close before her eyes. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it scarcely required the teacher-habit, to perceive that the 
doll's dressmaker was inclined to be bitter on the difference between 
herself and other children. But both master and pupil understood it so. 
</p>
<p>
'Always running about and screeching, always playing and fighting, always 
skip-skip-skipping on the pavement and chalking it for their games! Oh! I 
know their tricks and their manners!' Shaking the little fist as before. 
'And that's not all. Ever so often calling names in through a person's 
keyhole, and imitating a person's back and legs. Oh! I know their tricks 
and their manners. And I'll tell you what I'd do, to punish 'em. There's 
doors under the church in the Square--black doors, leading into black 
vaults. Well! I'd open one of those doors, and I'd cram 'em all in, and 
then I'd lock the door and through the keyhole I'd blow in pepper.' 
</p>
<p>
'What would be the good of blowing in pepper?' asked Charley Hexam. 
</p>
<p>
'To set 'em sneezing,' said the person of the house, 'and make their eyes 
water. And when they were all sneezing and inflamed, I'd mock 'em through 
the keyhole. Just as they, with their tricks and their manners, mock a 
person through a person's keyhole!' 
</p>
<p>
An uncommonly emphatic shake of her little fist close before her eyes, 
seemed to ease the mind of the person of the house; for she added with 
recovered composure, 'No, no, no. No children for me. Give me grown-ups.' 
</p>
<p>
It was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature, for her poor 
figure furnished no clue to it, and her face was at once so young and so 
old. Twelve, or at the most thirteen, might be near the mark. 
</p>
<p>
'I always did like grown-ups,' she went on, 'and always kept company with 
them. So sensible. Sit so quiet. Don't go prancing and capering about! And 
I mean always to keep among none but grown-ups till I marry. I suppose I 
must make up my mind to marry, one of these days.' 
</p>
<p>
She listened to a step outside that caught her ear, and there was a soft 
knock at the door. Pulling at a handle within her reach, she said, with a 
pleased laugh: 'Now here, for instance, is a grown-up that's my particular 
friend!' and Lizzie Hexam in a black dress entered the room. 
</p>
<p>
'Charley! You!' 
</p>
<p>
Taking him to her arms in the old way--of which he seemed a little 
ashamed--she saw no one else. 
</p>
<p>
'There, there, there, Liz, all right my dear. See! Here's Mr Headstone 
come with me.' 
</p>
<p>
Her eyes met those of the schoolmaster, who had evidently expected to see 
a very different sort of person, and a murmured word or two of salutation 
passed between them. She was a little flurried by the unexpected visit, 
and the schoolmaster was not at his ease. But he never was, quite. 
</p>
<p>
'I told Mr Headstone you were not settled, Liz, but he was so kind as to 
take an interest in coming, and so I brought him. How well you look!' 
</p>
<p>
Bradley seemed to think so. 
</p>
<p>
'Ah! Don't she, don't she?' cried the person of the house, resuming her 
occupation, though the twilight was falling fast. 'I believe you she does! 
But go on with your chat, one and all: 
</p>
<poem>
<poem1>You one two three,</poem1>
<poem1>My com-pa-nie,</poem1>
<poem1>And don't mind me.'</poem1>
</poem>
<p0>
--pointing this impromptu rhyme with three points of her thin 
fore-finger. 
</p0>
<p>
'I didn't expect a visit from you, Charley,' said his sister. 'I supposed 
that if you wanted to see me you would have sent to me, appointing me to 
come somewhere near the school, as I did last time. I saw my brother near 
the school, sir,' to Bradley Headstone, 'because it's easier for me to go 
there, than for him to come here. I work about midway between the two 
places.' 
</p>
<p>
'You don't see much of one another,' said Bradley, not improving in 
respect of ease. 
</p>
<p>
'No.' With a rather sad shake of her head. 'Charley always does well, Mr 
Headstone?' 
</p>
<p>
'He could not do better. I regard his course as quite plain before him.' 
</p>
<p>
'I hoped so. I am so thankful. So well done of you, Charley dear! It is 
better for me not to come (except when he wants me) between him and his 
prospects. You think so, Mr Headstone?' 
</p>
<p>
Conscious that his pupil-teacher was looking for his answer, that he 
himself had suggested the boy's keeping aloof from this sister, now seen 
for the first time face to face, Bradley Headstone stammered: 
</p>
<p>
'Your brother is very much occupied, you know. He has to work hard. One 
cannot but say that the less his attention is diverted from his work, the 
better for his future. When he shall have established himself, why then--it 
will be another thing then.' 
</p>
<p>
Lizzie shook her head again, and returned, with a quiet smile: 'I always 
advised him as you advise him. Did I not, Charley?' 
</p>
<p>
'Well, never mind that now,' said the boy. 'How are you getting on?' 
</p>
<p>
'Very well, Charley. I want for nothing.' 
</p>
<p>
'You have your own room here?' 
</p>
<p>
'Oh yes. Upstairs. And it's quiet, and pleasant, and airy.' 
</p>
<p>
'And she always has the use of this room for visitors,' said the person of 
the house, screwing up one of her little bony fists, like an opera-glass, 
and looking through it, with her eyes and her chin in that quaint 
accordance. 'Always this room for visitors; haven't you, Lizzie dear?' 
</p>
<p>
It happened that Bradley Headstone noticed a very slight action of Lizzie 
Hexam's hand, as though it checked the doll's dressmaker. And it happened 
that the latter noticed him in the same instant; for she made a double 
eyeglass of her two hands, looked at him through it, and cried, with a 
waggish shake of her head: 'Aha! Caught you spying, did I?' 
</p>
<p>
It might have fallen out so, any way; but Bradley Headstone also noticed 
that immediately after this, Lizzie, who had not taken off her bonnet, 
rather hurriedly proposed that as the room was getting dark they should go 
out into the air. They went out; the visitors saying good-night to the 
doll's dressmaker, whom they left, leaning back in her chair with her arms 
crossed, singing to herself in a sweet thoughtful little voice. 
</p>
<p>
'I'll saunter on by the river,' said Bradley. 'You will be glad to talk 
together.' 
</p>
<p>
As his uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows, the 
boy said to his sister, petulantly: 
</p>
<p>
'When are you going to settle yourself in some Christian sort of place, 
Liz? I thought you were going to do it before now.' 
</p>
<p>
'I am very well where I am, Charley.' 
</p>
<p>
'Very well where you are! I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with 
me. How came you to get into such company as that little witch's?' 
</p>
<p>
'By chance at first, as it seemed, Charley. But I think it must have been 
by something more than chance, for that child--You remember the bills 
upon the walls at home?' 
</p>
<p>
'Confound the bills upon the walls at home! I want to forget the bills 
upon the walls at home, and it would be better for you to do the same,' 
grumbled the boy. 'Well; what of them?' 
</p>
<p>
'This child is the grandchild of the old man.' 
</p>
<p>
'What old man?' 
</p>
<p>
'The terrible drunken old man, in the list slippers and the night-cap.' 
</p>
<p>
The boy asked, rubbing his nose in a manner that half expressed vexation 
at hearing so much, and half curiosity to hear more: 'How came you to make 
that out? What a girl you are!' 
</p>
<p>
'The child's father is employed by the house that employs me; that's how I 
came to know it, Charley. The father is like his own father, a weak 
wretched trembling creature, falling to pieces, never sober. But a good 
workman too, at the work he does. The mother is dead. This poor ailing 
little creature has come to be what she is, surrounded by drunken people 
from her cradle--if she ever had one, Charley.' 
</p>
<p>
'I don't see what you have to do with her, for all that,' said the boy. 
</p>
<p>
'Don't you, Charley?' 
</p>
<p>
The boy looked doggedly at the river. They were at Millbank, and the river 
rolled on their left. His sister gently touched him on the shoulder, and 
pointed to it. 
</p>
<p>
'Any compensation--restitution--never mind the word, you know my 
meaning. Father's grave.' 
</p>
<p>
But he did not respond with any tenderness. After a moody silence he broke 
out in an ill-used tone: 
</p>
<p>
'It'll be a very hard thing, Liz, if, when I am trying my best to get up 
in the world, you pull me back.' 
</p>
<p>
'I, Charley?' 
</p>
<p>
'Yes, you, Liz. Why can't you let bygones be bygones? Why can't you, as Mr 
Headstone said to me this very evening about another matter, leave well 
alone? What we have got to do, is, to turn our faces full in our new 
direction, and keep straight on.' 
</p>
<p>
'And never look back? Not even to try to make some amends?' 
</p>
<p>
'You are such a dreamer,' said the boy, with his former petulance. 'It was 
all very well when we sat before the fire--when we looked into the 
hollow down by the flare--but we are looking into the real world, 
now.' 
</p>
<p>
'Ah, we were looking into the real world then, Charley!' 
</p>
<p>
'I understand what you mean by that, but you are not justified in it. I 
don't want, as I raise myself to shake you off, Liz. I want to carry you 
up with me. That's what I want to do, and mean to do. I know what I owe 
you. I said to Mr Headstone this very evening, “After all, my sister got 
me here.” Well, then. Don't pull me back, and hold me down. That's all I 
ask, and surely that's not unconscionable.' 
</p>
<p>
She had kept a steadfast look upon him, and she answered with composure: 
</p>
<p>
'I am not here selfishly, Charley. To please myself I could not be too far 
from that river.' 
</p>
<p>
'Nor could you be too far from it to please me. Let us get quit of it 
equally. Why should you linger about it any more than I? I give it a wide 
berth.' 
</p>
<p>
'I can't get away from it, I think,' said Lizzie, passing her hand across 
her forehead. 'It's no purpose of mine that I live by it still.' 
</p>
<p>
'There you go, Liz! Dreaming again! You lodge yourself of your own accord 
in a house with a drunken--tailor, I suppose--or something of 
the sort, and a little crooked antic of a child, or old person, or 
whatever it is, and then you talk as if you were drawn or driven there. 
Now, do be more practical.' 
</p>
<p>
She had been practical enough with him, in suffering and striving for him; 
but she only laid her hand upon his shoulder--not reproachfully--and 
tapped it twice or thrice. She had been used to do so, to soothe him when 
she carried him about, a child as heavy as herself. Tears started to his 
eyes. 
</p>
<p>
'Upon my word, Liz,' drawing the back of his hand across them, 'I mean to 
be a good brother to you, and to prove that I know what I owe you. All I 
say is, that I hope you'll control your fancies a little, on my account. 
I'll get a school, and then you must come and live with me, and you'll 
have to control your fancies then, so why not now? Now, say I haven't 
vexed you.' 
</p>
<p>
'You haven't, Charley, you haven't.' 
</p>
<p>
'And say I haven't hurt you.' 
</p>
<p>
'You haven't, Charley.' But this answer was less ready. 
</p>
<p>
'Say you are sure I didn't mean to. Come! There's Mr Headstone stopping 
and looking over the wall at the tide, to hint that it's time to go. Kiss 
me, and tell me that you know I didn't mean to hurt you.' 
</p>
<p>
She told him so, and they embraced, and walked on and came up with the 
schoolmaster. 
</p>
<p>
'But we go your sister's way,' he remarked, when the boy told him he was 
ready. And with his cumbrous and uneasy action he stiffly offered her his 
arm. Her hand was just within it, when she drew it back. He looked round 
with a start, as if he thought she had detected something that repelled 
her, in the momentary touch. 
</p>
<p>
'I will not go in just yet,' said Lizzie. 'And you have a distance before 
you, and will walk faster without me.' 
</p>
<p>
Being by this time close to Vauxhall Bridge, they resolved, in 
consequence, to take that way over the Thames, and they left her; Bradley 
Headstone giving her his hand at parting, and she thanking him for his 
care of her brother. 
</p>
<p>
The master and the pupil walked on, rapidly and silently. They had nearly 
crossed the bridge, when a gentleman came coolly sauntering towards them, 
with a cigar in his mouth, his coat thrown back, and his hands behind him. 
Something in the careless manner of this person, and in a certain lazily 
arrogant air with which he approached, holding possession of twice as much 
pavement as another would have claimed, instantly caught the boy's 
attention. As the gentleman passed the boy looked at him narrowly, and 
then stood still, looking after him. 
</p>
<p>
'Who is it that you stare after?' asked Bradley. 
</p>
<p>
'Why!' said the boy, with a confused and pondering frown upon his face, 
'It <i>is</i> that Wrayburn one!' 
</p>
<p>
Bradley Headstone scrutinized the boy as closely as the boy had 
scrutinized the gentleman. 
</p>
<p>
'I beg your pardon, Mr Headstone, but I couldn't help wondering what in 
the world brought <i>him </i>here!' 
</p>
<p>
Though he said it as if his wonder were past--at the same time 
resuming the walk--it was not lost upon the master that he looked 
over his shoulder after speaking, and that the same perplexed and 
pondering frown was heavy on his face. 
</p>
<p>
'You don't appear to like your friend, Hexam?' 
</p>
<p>
'I <i>don't</i> like him,' said the boy. 
</p>
<p>
'Why not?' 
</p>
<p>
'He took hold of me by the chin in a precious impertinent way, the first 
time I ever saw him,' said the boy. 
</p>
<p>
'Again, why?' 
</p>
<p>
'For nothing. Or--it's much the same--because something I 
happened to say about my sister didn't happen to please him.' 
</p>
<p>
'Then he knows your sister?' 
</p>
<p>
'He didn't at that time,' said the boy, still moodily pondering. 
</p>
<p>
'Does now?' 
</p>
<p>
The boy had so lost himself that he looked at Mr Bradley Headstone as they 
walked on side by side, without attempting to reply until the question had 
been repeated; then he nodded and answered, 'Yes, sir.' 
</p>
<p>
'Going to see her, I dare say.' 
</p>
<p>
'It can't be!' said the boy, quickly. 'He doesn't know her well enough. I 
should like to catch him at it!' 
</p>
<p>
When they had walked on for a time, more rapidly than before, the master 
said, clasping the pupil's arm between the elbow and the shoulder with his 
hand: 
</p>
<p>
'You were going to tell me something about that person. What did you say 
his name was?' 
</p>
<p>
'Wrayburn. Mr Eugene Wrayburn. He is what they call a barrister, with 
nothing to do. The first time he came to our old place was when my father 
was alive. He came on business; not that it was <i>his </i>business--<i>he</i> 
never had any business--he was brought by a friend of his.' 
</p>
<p>
'And the other times?' 
</p>
<p>
'There was only one other time that I know of. When my father was killed 
by accident, he chanced to be one of the finders. He was mooning about, I 
suppose, taking liberties with people's chins; but there he was, somehow. 
He brought the news home to my sister early in the morning, and brought 
Miss Abbey Potterson, a neighbour, to help break it to her. He was mooning 
about the house when I was fetched home in the afternoon--they didn't 
know where to find me till my sister could be brought round sufficiently 
to tell them--and then he mooned away.' 
</p>
<p>
'And is that all?' 
</p>
<p>
'That's all, sir.'

Bradley Headstone gradually released the boy's arm, as if he were 
thoughtful, and they walked on side by side as before. After a long 
silence between them, Bradley resumed the talk. 
</p>
<p>
'I suppose--your sister--' with a curious break both before and 
after the words, 'has received hardly any teaching, Hexam?' 
</p>
<p>
'Hardly any, sir.' 
</p>
<p>
'Sacrificed, no doubt, to her father's objections. I remember them in your 
case. Yet--your sister--scarcely looks or speaks like an 
ignorant person.' 
</p>
<p>
'Lizzie has as much thought as the best, Mr Headstone. Too much, perhaps, 
without teaching. I used to call the fire at home, her books, for she was 
always full of fancies--sometimes quite wise fancies, considering--when 
she sat looking at it.' 
</p>
<p>
'I don't like that,' said Bradley Headstone. 
</p>
<p>
His pupil was a little surprised by this striking in with so sudden and 
decided and emotional an objection, but took it as a proof of the master's 
interest in himself. It emboldened him to say: 
</p>
<p>
'I have never brought myself to mention it openly to you, Mr Headstone, 
and you're my witness that I couldn't even make up my mind to take it from 
you before we came out to-night; but it's a painful thing to think that if 
I get on as well as you hope, I shall be--I won't say disgraced, 
because I don't mean disgraced--but--rather put to the blush if it was 
known--by a sister who has been very good to me.' 
</p>
<p>
'Yes,' said Bradley Headstone in a slurring way, for his mind scarcely 
seemed to touch that point, so smoothly did it glide to another, 'and 
there is this possibility to consider. Some man who had worked his way 
might come to admire--your sister--and might even in time bring 
himself to think of marrying--your sister--and it would be a sad 
drawback and a heavy penalty upon him, if; overcoming in his mind other 
inequalities of condition and other considerations against it, this 
inequality and this consideration remained in full force.' 
</p>
<p>
'That's much my own meaning, sir.' 
</p>
<p>
'Ay, ay,' said Bradley Headstone, 'but you spoke of a mere brother. Now, 
the case I have supposed would be a much stronger case; because an 
admirer, a husband, would form the connexion voluntarily, besides being 
obliged to proclaim it: which a brother is not. After all, you know, it 
must be said of you that you couldn't help yourself: while it would be 
said of him, with equal reason, that he could.' 
</p>
<p>
'That's true, sir. Sometimes since Lizzie was left free by father's death, 
I have thought that such a young woman might soon acquire more than enough 
to pass muster. And sometimes I have even thought that perhaps Miss 
Peecher--' 
</p>
<p>
'For the purpose, I would advise Not Miss Peecher,' Bradley Headstone 
struck in with a recurrence of his late decision of manner. 
</p>
<p>
'Would you be so kind as to think of it for me, Mr Headstone?' 
</p>
<p>
'Yes, Hexam, yes. I'll think of it. I'll think maturely of it. I'll think 
well of it.' 
</p>
<p>
Their walk was almost a silent one afterwards, until it ended at the 
school-house. There, one of neat Miss Peecher's little windows, like the 
eyes in needles, was illuminated, and in a corner near it sat Mary Anne 
watching, while Miss Peecher at the table stitched at the neat little body 
she was making up by brown paper pattern for her own wearing. N.B. Miss 
Peecher and Miss Peecher's pupils were not much encouraged in the 
unscholastic art of needlework, by Government. 
</p>
<p>
Mary Anne with her face to the window, held her arm up. 
</p>
<p>
'Well, Mary Anne?' 
</p>
<p>
'Mr Headstone coming home, ma'am.' 
</p>
<p>
In about a minute, Mary Anne again hailed. 
</p>
<p>
'Yes, Mary Anne?' 
</p>
<p>
'Gone in and locked his door, ma'am.' 
</p>
<p>
Miss Peecher repressed a sigh as she gathered her work together for bed, 
and transfixed that part of her dress where her heart would have been if 
she had had the dress on, with a sharp, sharp needle.
